            "p": "Castle Meadow Campus Design Team Ares Landscape Architects Castle Meadow Campus will provide a modern and welcoming city centre campus for the University, but it will also provide a landscape that pays homage to the site’s rich history. The local area is famous for Nottingham’s Crocus meadows where cowkeeper’s pastured their cows, and for the rest of the Nottingham population it was an area of natural beauty, with the castle itself providing long distance views for miles. To achieve a vision that consolidates the historic beauty and significance of the area and an innovative design approach, the following key landscape drivers have been identified: The masterplan is split into four key zones: The site’s transformation from a series of access roads and parking bays prioritising vehicles, to a pedestrianised public realm with a series of external spaces along its spine will mean that the development will function as a campus that meets University of Nottingham’s goals of being dynamic, open, accessible and welcoming place. The landscape scheme will be designed to respond to a series of benchmarks and principles including Urban Greening Factor (UGF) calculations; biodiversity net gain; sustainable urban drainage principles such as rain gardens and permeable paving. The campus will be as progressive as possible whilst respecting the grade II listed architecture."
