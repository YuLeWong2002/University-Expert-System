It shall be the general duty of the Head of School to ensure that adequate supervision is provided for all candidates during their period of directed study for the degree. This shall not detract from the duty of all supervisors to supervise adequately all students allocated to them. 3. The supervisor will normally be the person directly responsible for the project component of the course. In addition to supervision of the project the supervisor will also be required to direct the student as to the relevant taught component of the course. 4. A candidate for the degree of Master of Research must have pursued in this University a full- or part-time course of study comprising a programme of generic training, a research project and, as appropriate, an element of assessed taught modules. Includes: completion of generic training equivalent to 20 credits 5. This component requires the satisfactory completion of generic training equivalent to 20 credits. These credits can be accumulated from courses offered from within the Research Training Programme run by the Graduate School or other units offering generic training within the University, or from within any other generic training courses run within individual Schools. The generic courses will be selected in consultation with the supervisor(s) and should be cognate with the student's research topic. This element of the degree will not be assessed but candidates are required to attend at least 70% of the course(s). The selection of these modules is at the discretion of the student's School. Guidance on the appropriateness of the content of modules is available from the Graduate School. For more information, please consult the following: Graduate School 6. In addition to the generic training programme candidates are required to undertake assessed work to the equivalent of 160 credits. These credits can be obtained entirely from a research project in a subject within the scope of the School concerned. The candidate will be required to present a dissertation with a maximum length of 35,000 words (ie inclusive of appendices, footnotes, tables, and bibliography). The dissertation should embody the result of the candidate's advanced study and research. The dissertation must be presented within one year of the start of the course in the case of full-time study or up to four years in the case of part-time study. 7. A candidate may choose, with the agreement of the supervisor, to take up to 40 credits of taught modules. These must be selected from level 4 level modules (or, exceptionally, level 3) and must be clearly cognate with the student's research topic. In this instance the candidate will be required to take any relevant assessments associated with these modules. At the discretion of the School, when students take taught credits as part of their MRes degree, the word limit for the dissertation can be reduced.
