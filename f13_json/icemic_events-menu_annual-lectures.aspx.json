            "p": "We are thrilled to announce the launch of the prestigious ICEMiC Amal Treacher Kabesh Annual Lectures, dedicated to the memory of our esteemed colleague, Dr Amal Treacher Kabesh. This series will honor her significant contributions to the field of sociology and her commitment to fostering discussions on critical social issues. Each year, the ICEMiC Annual Lectures will feature a one-hour presentation by a prominent sociologist, addressing topics that resonate with our core themes: race, ethnicity, religion, class, citizenship, and migration. We believe this lecture series will provide a platform for stimulating dialogue and innovative ideas. For more information about the lecture series or to inquire about participation, please reach out to the ICEMiC Director at morteza.hashemi@nottingham.ac.uk We look forward to your participation in this event and hope to see you there!
