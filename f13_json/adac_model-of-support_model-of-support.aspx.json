            "p": "The Advanced Data analysis Centre will participate in collaborative projects, bringing expertise in a range of data analysis disciplines. We strongly encourage all researchers writing grant proposals to consider inclusion of ADAC staff onto their grants in order to ensure access to ADAC expertise. Please contact ADAC staff as early as possible during the planning of a grant proposal, as we are able to offer study design and grant writing assistance. It is expected that ADAC staff are acknowledged appropriately on research outcomes. This will be agreed by ADAC staff at the outset of a project and reviewed periodically. To discuss your research proposal, please contact us through the Digital Research Service Enquiry Potal. Research Project Enquiries For any other query, please email us: General Enquiries ADAC was a joint initiative between the School of Computer Science and the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science. We have since grown and became known as Digital Research Service, part of DTS. Please see our Contact Us page for telephone and email contact points"
