            "p": "The CDT is a partnership between UCL, the University of Nottingham (UoN), and a network of industrial and clinical partners from across the UK pharmaceutical, and healthcare sector. AMD&D CDT graduates will be expert practitioners at integrating laboratory and digital research, crucial to accelerate medicines development. They will develop skills to effectively communicate, work within, and lead research teams. UCL and UoN will work with our external partners, such that the training and research undertaken in the CDT is directly relevant to the most significant challenges in medicines development and embedded in an industrial and clinical environment, with direct patient involvement. This will allow us to directly contribute to the acceleration of medicines development, and ultimately will deliver major benefits to patients as new medicines reach clinic. Professor Gareth Williams, the UCL CDT Director, said “I am delighted that EPSRC has recognised the importance of doctoral training in medicines development and funded our CDT. We look forward to welcoming our first cohort of students in 2025”. Prof Snow Stolnik, CDT Co-Director at UoN added “This EPSRC funding will educate a new generation of researchers equipped to lead future translation of potential new drugs into medicines accessible to patients.” The Nottingham co-applicants include Professor Snow Stolnik, Dr Maria Marlow, Professor Cameron Alexander, Dr Mischa Zelzer and Dr Frankie Rawson. The members of this team are leading and delivering the preceding CDT in Transformative Pharmaceutical Technologies. View the UKRI press release. Find out more on the UCL website.
