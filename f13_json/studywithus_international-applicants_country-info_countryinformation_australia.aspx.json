            "p": "Unlock your potential at a world-leading university with a truly international student community. Applicants from Australia do not normally require a foundation programme. Australian senior secondary certificates with relevant Australian University Matriculation grades are normally accepted for undergraduate entry. We offer foundation courses for international students who are not qualified for direct entry to our undergraduate degree courses. These courses are available at the University of Nottingham International College, just next to University Park Campus, in partnership with Kaplan International Colleges. Find out more about the courses, entry requirements and progression options on Kaplan's website: Applications and enquiries for these courses are handled by Kaplan and the college. International foundation courses Full-time courses across our five faculties typically last for three to four years, although some degrees such as medicine and architecture have a longer duration. A typical ATAR requirement for a course with an AAB entry requirement for A levels is an ATAR of 92. For Queensland this equates to Band 1 â€“ 6 in OP. Our Undergraduate Prospectus lists entry requirements for A levels and International Baccalaureate students for each course. Students taking APs or SATs should refer to our entry requirements for the USA. We offer a wide range of postgraduate masters degree programmes across our five faculties. Full-time masters courses typically last for one year. A bachelors degree from a recognised university will be considered for masters entry. Check course details in our Postgraduate Prospectus to see whether your chosen course requires the equivalent of an Upper Second Class (2:1) or Lower Second Class (2:2) degree. For honours degrees, requirements are the same as those for UK bachelors degrees (honours). For ordinary degrees, requirements are typically 70% for courses requiring a UK 2:1, and 60% for course requiring a UK 2:2. Our PhD courses, available across a wide range of subject areas, typically include three years of full time research followed by an optional writing-up period of one year to complete your thesis. A masters and bachelors degree from a recognised university are usually required for PhD entry, although exceptional students may be considered for PhD entry without a masters qualification. See the masters section for guidance on the grades we typically require from Australian universities. These will vary depending on the university where you have studied and the course you are applying for at Nottingham. You should identify possible supervisors at Nottingham before applying and prepare a research proposal to submit with your application.
