            "p": "At the University, we go the extra mile to provide dedicated support to certain student groups through group provision led by our Support and Wellbeing Team.

Currently, we have the following provision in place, offering consistent support and a dedicated point of contact: Students who meet the criteria for any of these groups can initiate self-referral using the provided contact information above.

Our dedicated support is designed to complement existing resources rather than replace them."
