            "p": "The Institute for Name-Studies (INS) was established as an umbrella organisation for the research activities of the EPNS and name-studies scholars at the University of Nottingham. It has a specialist library within the School of English. The English Placeâ€‘Name Society (EPNS) is the established national body for the subject; its offices and collections are housed in the Institute. The INS conducts numerous research projects into the origins and meanings of names and place-names, derived from English, Norse, British Celtic, French, and Latin languages. It also provides high-quality resources for both the study and analysis of place-names, which are used by historians, linguists, and geographers alike. INS researchers collaborate with internal and external partners on a range of interdisciplinary projects, exploring the potential of place-names to further understanding of the historical development of society, landscape and environment.
