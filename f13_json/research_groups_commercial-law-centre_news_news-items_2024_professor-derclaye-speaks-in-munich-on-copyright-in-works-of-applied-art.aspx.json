            "p": "Professor Derclaye was invited to give a talk at the German branch of ALAI (the international association for copyright) on 18 October 2024. She discussed results of her ongoing research on copyright harmonisation in the 27 Member States, mapping the situation in the national courts in relation to works of applied art. There were several other presentations by lawyers and academics from Germany, Austria, Sweden and the Czech republic. Lively discussions ensued between the presenters and the audience (constituted of German practitioners, judges and academics) especially in light of the cases on the protection of works of applied art pending before the CJEU (MIO and konektra).
