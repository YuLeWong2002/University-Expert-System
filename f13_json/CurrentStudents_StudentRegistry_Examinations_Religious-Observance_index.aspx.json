            "p": "The University of Nottingham respects the rights and religious views of its students. The University's protocol relating to absence from an examination for reason of religious observance sets out the procedure for students who are unable to take examinations on a particular day during the published examination periods for reasons of religious observance. The deadline for submission of completed forms to School Examinations Officers is: Where this is not possible to consider a student’s requests, and the student has completed the Religious Observance Form by the published deadline, the student should contact their School Examinations Officer for further advice. The School concerned may make the following alternative arrangements: It is anticipated that Schools will make every effort to ensure an alternative arrangement for a student is possible. In exceptional circumstances, the School should consider offering the student a deferral of their examination until the August/September resit period under the University’s Extenuating Circumstances Policy.
