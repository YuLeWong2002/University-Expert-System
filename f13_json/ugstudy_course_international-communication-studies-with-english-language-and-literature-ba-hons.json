Additional courses on offer include Community Interpreting, Introduction to Translation, Modern British Fiction as well as reading Chinese and Japanese Literature.

It is designed to equip students for further studies in the field of linguistics as a whole, and to develop individual specialisms in the future. Ideally, students should be well prepared to become more specialised in any of the areas covered, and take initial interests further. At the end of this module, students should be able to define the discipline, and the main pre-occupations of its sub-fields. Students will be expected to have developed an understanding of linguistic contrasts, from the phonological to the pragmatic level, and of the types of analyses open to students of those fields. This module introduces students to the core areas of linguistics, discourse, language acquisition, and pragmatics, focusing on several broad areas pertaining to linguistics and its methodological issues in phonetics, phonology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.
