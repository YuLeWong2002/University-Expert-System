            "p": "Our style guide helps us work together to create things that feel and sound like the University of Nottingham. When people recognise us in our work, the university comes to life in their hearts and minds. Here you'll find tools, techniques and advice (and a few rules) to inject that University of Nottingham vibe into your words. If you can't see what you're looking for, get in touch. If something needs adding, we can do that. Here is a full list of our style guide entries. Please contact us if you feel there's something missing or you can't find what you're looking for within the style guide."
