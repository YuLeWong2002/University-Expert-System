            "p": "Current research focuses on Metal nanoparticles and nanoclusters and their outstanding size-dependent optical properties that make them the ideal candidates to build optical nanosensors. Careful formulation is often needed to ensure these nanoprobes are stable for sensing application, without compromising their sensitivity. Other work also focuses on synthesizing nanoparticles and nanotubes with potent antimicrobial activities for waste water treatment. Other work in the group focuses on development of new bioassays derived from fluorogenic biotemplated-nanoclusters or colorimetric gold nanoparticles.
