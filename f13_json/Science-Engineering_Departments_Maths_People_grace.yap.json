            "p": "Associate Professor, I obtained my PhD in 2012 from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, of which the area that I investigated was the improvement on the data envelopment analysis. I am an associate professor in the School of Mathematical Sciences since 2016. I was involved in various revamp cycles of mathematics modules in the foundation level, setting up the BSc Mathematics and Management programme as well as leading the programme accreditation process. I contributed in computational improvements in various areas including data envelopment analysis, fuzzy models, long memory processes, Markov switching models and state space models. I currently convene the modules of statistics and statistical inference. I am interested in various aspects of computational statistics, My research area involves state space models, Markov switching models and long memory processes, and time series analysis. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8001"
