You can use UCAS Hub to view the status of your application. We receive a number of results directly from the examining boards via UCAS. Applicants who have taken the following qualifications do not need to send in confirmation of their results: Your results will be compared against your offers and you'll hear about your place through UCAS. You'll then receive pre-registration information directly from the University. We receive the majority of results directly, but we will contact you if we haven't received your results (i.e. if you are a private candidate). If you are taking a qualification other than those listed above, it is your responsibility to send your certificates and transcripts to us. You can upload scanned copies to our online application system, NottinghamHub. We can also accept high-quality photos as long as the document is an official transcript of your marks. All results must be in English. If your documents need to be translated into English then you must send legally certified copies to us. Further advice for international and EU applicants is available on our international webpages. You will need to bring original or certified copies of your qualifications with you when you register as a new student. When we have received your results we will assess your qualifications and update your offer status. In some cases we may still be able to accept students who have narrowly missed the grades stated in your offer conditions, so please wait for us to assess your results. If your results do not qualify you for your chosen course(s) – or if you want to change your study plans – you may be able to apply for another course through Clearing. Certificates and transcripts will be accepted by email only if they are sent by a school, college or one of our official overseas representatives. Copies should be sent to results@nottingham.ac.uk. In this situation you might meet the conditions of your insurance choice. Your status will be updated in UCAS, and you'll then receive pre-registration information directly from the university. If you have not met the conditions of your University of Nottingham offer and there is no decision showing in UCAS Hub, you can contact us through the confirmation and Clearing hotline (see our Clearing webpages). If you have not met the conditions of your University of Nottingham offer and there is no decision showing in UCAS Hub, you can contact our Admissions team on results@nottingham.ac.uk Applicants who have taken the following qualifications do not need to send in confirmation of your results: Your results will be compared against your offers and you'll hear about your place through UCAS. You'll then receive pre-registration information directly from the university. If you are taking a qualification other than those listed above, it is your responsibility to send your certificates and transcripts to us. You can upload scanned copies to our online application system, NottinghamHub. We can also accept high-quality photos as long as the document is an official transcript of your marks on headed paper. The deadline for providing us with all of your results is specified in your offer, which you can view on UCAS Hub. If you have already sent us documents in the post, travel restrictions within the UK mean that we are currently unable to process these. They will be held securely at the university and processed once these restrictions are lifted. To avoid delays to your application, please ensure that you have uploaded scanned copies (as detailed above). Firstly, check UCAS Hub to see whether you have been accepted by any of your choices. If you took qualifications that we don't receive via UCAS, see our guidance above about submitting your results. The course you're looking for might still have places available through Clearing. Clearing International applicants should first read all sections on this page, as well as our additional information. Have the phone numbers of your firm and insurance choice universities to hand. Lines will be busy. Ensure you can get online and access UCAS Hub. You might also want to visit the Clearing pages just in case. Whether you don't get the grades, you get better grades than you expected or you want to reconsider your study plans, it's always a good idea to know how Clearing works."
