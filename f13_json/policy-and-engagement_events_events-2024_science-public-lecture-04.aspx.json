We all do not like to have damaged tissues or diseases in our organs. But the sad reality is that at some point in our lives we may have wounds in our skins, arthritis in our joints, fractures in our bones, or cancers in our organs. The possibility to fully repair or regenerate damaged tissues or organs, and restoring their functions, has been a dream of Dr Babatunde Okesola and many other researchers. In this lecture, Dr Okesola will showcase how he and his team have created soft materials that resemble Jell-O (jelly) to repair damaged tissues and explore why we have cancer. You can view a recording of the lecture here. This lecture is part of our monthly science public lecture series. These events showcase research from scientists at the University of Nottingham and are free and open to all!
