The objective of my thesis research is to explore the relationships among the constructs of negative events related to performance management (PM) system, negative emotions, perception of fairness, acceptance of PM system, work engagement and turnover intention.The first part of this study aims to explore the negative events (related to PM system) which are significant to the general workers of manufacturing factories in Malaysia. The major negative emotions correspond to major negative events were determined from this part of the study as well. In-depth interviews and focus group discussion were organised to obtain insights from participants. In the second part of this study, the major negative emotions identified from the first part of the study were correlated to three work attitudes â€“ acceptance of PM system, work engagement and turnover intention. In these relationships, it was hypothesised that perception of fairness acted as a mediator.
