            "p": "You are warmly invited to attend Prof Barbara Trish’s first Leverhulme Lecture on ‘The 2024 US Election: A New Playbook?’ on 29 October at 6pm in LASS B63. In the final days of the U.S. general election campaign, one thing is for sure: uncertainty prevails. The campaign has been marked by unusual twists and turns. It remains to be seen whether the same will hold on Election Day and its aftermath – and more generally, whether 2024 will be a one-off or will reshape the terms of U.S. campaign politics into the future. Barbara Trish is Professor of Political Science at Grinnell College (Iowa, USA) and a Leverhulme Trust Visiting Professor in the School of Politics and International Relations for the 24-25 academic year, where she is conducting research on the use of AI in the 2024 US and UK Elections. Professor Trish's first Leverhulme Lecture is free and open to the public. Students and academic colleagues from all levels and schools are encouraged to attend. Please register for the lecture. A reception will be held immediately following the lecture and is open to all registered attendees. email: fernando.casal.bertoa@nottingham.ac.uk"
