The course combines modules taught by The School of Biomedical Sciences, The School of Pharmacy and The School of Biosciences along with undertaking optional modules from both inside and outside the Faculty of Science and Engineering. During your first year, you will gain a broad coverage in biomedical science, you will be introduced to key systems and pathways in the human body and be able to relate these to diseases. Your second year will focus on scientific research techniques including modules on drug usage and their mechanisms of action. This is followed by a 12 week summer placement to gain real-working experience along with specialised modules in your final year to address the current and future content of medical and health sciences. The dynamic world of Biomedical Science underpins much of modern healthcare. As illnesses and treatments become more sophisticated so too does the need for a more advanced understanding of the human body and the effects drugs and diseases have on it. The course is aimed at students who have an interest in the study of human healthcare and the differences between normal and diseased human biological states. The course is a three-year honours programme offering a chance to study internationally at Nottingham’s UK campus for the third year. The school has a strong track record with 10 graduating classes since 2010 and many of our graduates now work in leading biomedical and biotechnology companies both locally in Malaysia and worldwide. All candidates are considered on an individual basis and we accept a broad range of qualifications. The entrance requirements below apply to 2024 entry. We strongly encourage all interested students to apply. Our students come to us with a diverse range of qualifications and we are also reviewing and accepting grades based on the minimum acceptable (and those who are holding grades with near misses). The only way for us to fully determine eligibility is through the submission of a completed application. Entry requirements in the prospectus and website may not always apply and individual offers may vary. The Foundation in Science is a 1+3 year programme that results in direct progression to the undergraduate degrees offered within the Faculty of Science. This rigorous programme provides students with a strong academic background that will result in enhanced language, mathematics, critical thinking and study skills. Students on this programme also chose from a range of elective modules that provide the opportunity to sample topics related to their chosen undergraduate pathway such as chemistry, ecology, computer programming or psychology. Our step-by-step guide contains everything you need to know about applying for undergraduate courses. Semenyih Campus is 48km from Kuala Lumpur International Airport and just 45 minutes’ drive from the famous city centre with its iconic Petronas Twin Towers. On arrival, you are immersed in the green jungle backdrop that Malaysia provides with wildlife, sunshine and campus lake. The campus is home to our business, education, science and engineering schools, which sit alongside a sports centre, library and student accommodation. The University has everything a modern day student could wish for with the added bonus of being located in central Asia allowing you to travel further afield in your free time. Public transport is plentiful with free shuttle services operating on some routes. Taxi/Grab services in Malaysia are very reasonable and used widely by the student community. Studying Biomedical Science provides you with the perfect platform to gain knowledge and skills for a rewarding career in industry or academia. Graduates from the Biomedical Sciences programme are exposed to a wide variety of careers ranging from medical research to pharmaceuticals and academia. Many students also progress to postgraduate research degrees, while others go on to medical writing, patent work and drug discovery. Biomedical Science is also one of the few courses eligible to apply for graduate entry to medicine. The Biomedical Sciences BSc (Hons) programme is an undergraduate degree offered by the University of Nottingham Malaysia that focuses on the study of human biology and disease. The curriculum is designed to provide students with the theoretical knowledge and practical skills necessary to pursue a career in the field. The Biomedical Sciences BSc (Hons) course is a full-time programme that takes three years to complete. Graduates of the Biomedical Sciences BSc (Hons) course can pursue a variety of careers in the biomedical sciences, including: The Biomedical Sciences BSc (Hons) course uses a combination of lectures, tutorials, laboratory work, and independent study to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. The University of Nottingham Malaysia provides state-of-the-art facilities for students in the Biomedical Sciences BSc (Hons) programme, including: Yes, students can participate in research projects under the supervision of academic staff. This provides students with the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in scientific research and develop their practical skills. Yes, the University of Nottingham Malaysia offers a variety of financial support options for students, including scholarships. However, these can be availed by students who meet certain criteria, such as academic achievement, financial need, or specific programme requirements. The average salary for a Biomedical Scientist in Malaysia is RM 32000 [Source: PayScale]. This content was last updated on 10 July 2024.
