            "p": "Zero Carbon Cluster The destination of a zero carbon economy will be reached through multiple pathways. We focus on specific zero carbon pathways that can leverage our research strengths to scale and grow high TRL (technology-readiness-level) commercial products and services. This enables us to decarbonise carbon-intensive industries such as heavy transport and manufacturing. Our initial pathways are electrification and hydrogen propulsion systems. Advanced research in these areas contributes to the growth of a globally significant industry cluster in the East Midlands, and to solving some of the worldâ€™s greatest zero carbon challenges for the transport and manufacturing sectors.
