            "p": "This section of the quality manual explains the process if someone wishes to make changes to the quality manual. This information is relevant to staff and students, learners and apprentices across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses. There are two ways to raise an item with Quality and Standards Committee: How to submit an 'outside regulation' case to the Quality and Standards Committee Papers to QSC can be submitted from any party with an interest in quality assurance at the University, where there is a collective need for a change, a correction, or a review of a specific policy or area of quality assurance. It is necessary that any such requests have consulted broadly across the University before submission (but if you need any support with this, for example if you’re considering preparing a paper, please get in touch and we can help). This enables collective consideration of the issue in question and will likely lead to more robust improvement suggestions. Any suggested changes would need to be submitted to QSC for consideration and approval must be granted before any changes can be implemented. Guidance on how to submit a paper is provided below. For relatively minor changes, you need to use the cover sheet and the quality manual mark up template. For more substantive changes, you will additionally need to use the paper template to give a fuller explanation of the changes being proposed and the reasons for them. The ‘QSC paper submission guidance’ document below will be useful for you to review, particularly if this is the first time you are submitting a paper.
