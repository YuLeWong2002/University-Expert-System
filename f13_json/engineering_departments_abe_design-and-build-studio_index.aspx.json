            "p": "The design+build studio at the University of Nottingham offers architecture students an immersive, hands-on, learning experience. Students in this studio spend the year experimenting, designing, inventing, and constructing pieces of architecture. In previous years the design+build studio has focused on impactful projects though our crèche initiative which took place in South Africa. The design+build studio’s projects focus on community projects with a net positive impact. Our partnerships in South Africa, and Nottingham have encouraged our students to focus on the potential impact of the projects. Our past projects in South Africa have offered a comprehensive project-based learning experience with a tangible impact on our students and our community partners. The design+build studio is rooted in the idea that the study of architecture is inherently about buildings, and that through the act of building we can be better designers. We work to understand the inter-connected nature of design, construction and people. Our studio engages students who embody the idea that architecture and design can contribute positive solutions. The design+build studio’s projects focus on community projects with a net positive impact. Our established partnerships in South Africa, and our future projects in Nottingham encourage our students to focus on the potential impact of the projects.
