            "p": "Each student will normally be assigned 2 academic supervisors who will provide guidance on the formal specification of the topic, the structure and organisation of the thesis and the general direction of the research. Regular supervision helps to ensure that the research progresses in the appropriate way. Full-time doctoral students meet with their supervisors on at least 10 occasions during the year. For part-time students, at least 6 meetings take place. This section lists the general research areas of staff members at Nottingham University Business School Malaysia who supervise PhD research. Please refer to the research interests of members of staff concerned to determine if your research interests coincide with those of a potential supervisor. You may also refer to Research at the Business School to determine if your research interests correspond with the wider research agenda within the School. Please note that the list below does not indicate the availability or capacity of any member of staff at any particular time to undertake supervision of new students. Please contact the Coordinator of the PhD Programme for further information.
