            "p": "University Park Campus, Nottingham, UK Are you curious about how advanced techniques in mathematical modelling are used? Do you want to learn about insights from the latest mathematical research? Perhaps you are keen to apply this learning to a real-life situation with a placement year as part of your degree. During this MMath you will cover these topics, learning from dedicated mathematicians. Our degree gives you the chance to learn more about the exciting research our academics are working on, whilst equipping you with the knowledge and skills to carry out your own research. You'll develop your skills in problem solving and analysis. The course will also enable you to enhance and develop your transferable skills in project work, group study and presentations, then apply them in the workplace during your year in industry. There's a range of specialised modules across all branches of mathematics, based upon our diverse research interests. Mandatory Year 1 Algebra Applied Mathematics Core Mathematics Probability and Statistics 1 The above is a sample of the typical modules we offer, but is not intended to be construed or relied on as a definitive list of what might be available in any given year. This content was last updated on Thursday 13 June 2024. Due to timetabling availability, there may be restrictions on some module combinations. The majority of modules are worth 10 or 20 credits. You will study modules totalling 120 credits in each year. As a guide one credit equates to approximately 10 hours of work. During the first year, you will typically spend approximately: You can attend drop-in sessions each week up to a maximum of two hours and the remaining time will be spent in independent study. In later years, you are likely to spend up to 15 hours per week in lectures and workshops subject to your module selection. In your first year you will meet with your personal tutor every week during term time. In small groups of 5-6 students, you'll run through core topics and practice working together in a group to solve problems and communicate mathematics effectively. All of our modules are delivered by lecturers or professors. PhD students sometimes support problem classes and computing workshops in their areas of expertise. Lectures in the first two years often include at least 200 students but class sizes are much more variable in the third year subject to module selection. Studying for a degree at the University of Nottingham will provide you with the type of skills and experiences that will prove invaluable in any career, whichever direction you decide to take.
