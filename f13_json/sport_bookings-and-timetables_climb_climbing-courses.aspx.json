            "p": "Whether you are learning to climb and aren’t sure what to do next, have hit a plateau in your climbing, or are just ready to push your limits, we’ve got you covered. Climbing is a fantastic physical and mental challenge. We provide a variety of beginner climbing sessions and intermediate coaching lessons which are designed to help push climbers to new heights. Led by our highly qualified coaches, our coaching sessions will take you through the main safety principles of climbing and push you to be your best. Has your climbing plateaued? Try our Strength Assessment session with our experienced coaches. We use the Pitch 6 Force Board (strain gauge) to measure your pull strength in a short set of assessments. Once you have completed the assessment our coaches will suggest some training and equipment to help improve your overall strength. This is ideally for experienced climbers who are currently stuck around V4/V5 level bouldering. This session is not a 'climbing' coaching session. Duration: Approx 30mins Cost - Currently this is free service to members. Please note that sessions are subject to last minute cancellations. +44 (0)115 748 7000 sport@nottingham.ac.uk Find our opening times here."
