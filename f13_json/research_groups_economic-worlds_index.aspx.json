            "p": "The Economic Worlds research theme is a vibrant and internationally recognised research cluster. We undertake research on a dynamic range of contemporary economic geographical phenomena and processes. Our research foci include the economic geographies of finance, the financial system and financialisation; the economic geographies of fashion, creative industries and consumption; the study of the transformation of global-city regions and of the production of new economic spaces, ranging from the digital through to the remaking of national economic space. We are characterised by the development of innovative theoretical approaches to the economic that are attuned to the cultural, political and social dimensions of economic life. This is coupled with a strong commitment to rigorous empirical research using a range of methodologies. This research agenda is shaped through four related, cross-cutting themes: School of Geography Sir Clive Granger Building University of Nottingham Nottingham, NG7 2RD +44 (0)115 951 5559"
