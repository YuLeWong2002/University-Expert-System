Student networks are led by students, and our staff networks are led by members of staff. Meetings and social events take place throughout the year in an informal and relaxed environment. Many of the people that get involved with the networks find a great deal of support from the colleagues they meet, which they in turn can provide to others. So why not get in touch with the relevant networks today? Student networks and societies Staff networks Trent Building University Park Campus Nottingham"
