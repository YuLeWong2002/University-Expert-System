            "p": "The Smart Products Beacon explored the future of products and how they are made. Future products will harness digital technologies to deliver new kinds of consumer experience that blend traditional goods and services. They will be made in smarter ways by being co-created by both manufacturers and consumers over a lifetime of use. And they will be trusted in how they use our data to deliver evermore personalised and adaptive experiences. Ending in August 2024, the Smart Products Beacon was instrumental in securing major grants that are now continuing its work, including the Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Hub and RAi UK. Additionally, another successful output from the Beacon was the creation of the Cobot Maker Space - a vibrant maker space based at the University of Nottingham partnering the EPSRC-funded Horizon Digital Economy Research, the Trustworthy Autonomous Systems Hub and RAi UK. Please note that this is now an archive site. Please visit the Cobot Maker Space via: https://cobotmakerspace.org/ to discover more about our sociotechnical research that addresses the connection between people, AI-driven robots and autonomous systems. We tackle a new challenge facing the world â€“ how can we harness the digital revolution to make smarter and trusted products.
