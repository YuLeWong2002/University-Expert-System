            "p": "Science in the Park About the event These are just some of the questions being explored at this popular event on Saturday 9th March, as part of national Science Week, which will feature a range of interactive exhibits suitable for pre-school children through to adults. Scientists and engineers from the University of Nottingham will be showcasing a range of exciting research with visitors having the opportunity to find out about a wide range of scientific topics including fossil plants, elephant welfare, good and bad bugs, cosmic timelines, DNA, geology, physics, biology and much more! Event attendees can also enjoy Wollaton Hall’s very own Natural History Museum, which features a bird room, evolutions gallery and temporary exhibition space. Please note that due to unprecedented demand this event is now sold out. UPDATE: Thank you to everyone who attended this year's Science in the Park event! We hope you had a wonderful time. We are delighted to announce that the winners of our visitor satisfaction survey prize draw are Sally Kirkham-Wiley and Anthony Shipley who each win a LEGO set worth £40.
