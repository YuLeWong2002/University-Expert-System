            "p": "Changing systems, responses and behaviours Technology is important, but it become meaningless unless it's used. Social scientists work to understand systems and behaviours â€“ why and how things work in societies. They therefore play a vital role in solving the many complex barriers that prevent potential solutions from being implemented. The research below includes studies ranging from why people choose certain behaviours over others, to how we can finance the transition in a just and equitable way. Professor Simon Mosey, Director of the Haydn Green Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Nottingham, demonstrates the importance of supporting entrepreneurship within disadvantaged communities to address environmental challenges."
