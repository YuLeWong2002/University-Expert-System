            "p": "While the design-based component of the project may be drawn, modelled, filmed, built, etc, candidates will be required to incorporate this research as an integral component of an accompanying written thesis. Good architecture embraces a holistic approach to design and as a consequence the environmental strategies embodied within buildings present considerable challenges. They need to reconcile the often conflicting considerations of climate, building function and user expectation, while at the same time being mindful of energy related carbon emissions. Projects in environmental design typically reflect the integrated nature of these strategies and explore areas such as natural ventilation, passive heating and cooling, solar protection, fabric thermal storage, daylight and solar strategies and architectural acoustics. These are intrinsically linked to the tectonics of architecture and considerable potential exists to explore the opportunities offered where these overlaps occur, eg the environmental performance of facades, natural ventilation of high rise buildings, etc. Urban design is concerned with the city as a field of analysis and intervention. Research in urban design explores the complex relationship between spatial and design issues and social and economic urban processes. PhD topics are defined in conjunction with supervisors and can cover many different aspects of urban design, such as: History and Theory of Urban Design; Public Realm; Sustainable Cities; Urban Conservation & Revitalisation; Innovation Environments and Waterfront Regeneration. All candidates are considered on an individual basis and we accept a broad range of qualifications.
