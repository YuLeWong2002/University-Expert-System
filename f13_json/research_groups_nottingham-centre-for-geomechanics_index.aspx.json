            "p": "Humans interact with soils and rock in all manner of construction and development activities. Examples include the foundations beneath our buildings, the underground networks of tunnels and pipelines we rely on for transport and water, and the extraction of natural resources from the ground. The Nottingham Centre for Geomechanics (NCG) conducts research which helps us to understand the complex ways that these natural materials behave, so that safe and effective engineering solutions can be developed. The centre brings together expertise in civil, materials, and mining engineering to solve all forms of soil and rock related problems in engineering design and construction.
