            "p": "CANDAL aims to bring together clinicians, service users and academics with an interest in neurodevelopmental disorders, including attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Tourette syndrome (TS). The centre was established as an Institute of Mental Health (IMH) Centre of Excellence in 2012 under the directorship of Chris Hollis, Professor of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry. Neurodevelopmental disorders such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Tourettes Syndrome (TS), and Autism spectrum Disorder (ASD) are common and impairing conditions that frequently co-exist and affect about 1 in 20 people across the lifespan. The recognition of these conditions has increased rapidly in recent years leading to concerns about both over- and under- diagnosis. The growing awareness that these conditions not only affect children and young people, but typically persist into adult life has created a significant unmet clinical and research need to understand developmental factors in presentation and treatment response. CANDAL is unique because unlike other research groups that typically focus on a single disorder either in children or adults, we study these conditions in combination and across the lifespan.
