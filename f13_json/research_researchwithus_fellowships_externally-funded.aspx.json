            "p": "Apply for an external fellowship with Nottingham and join a university with an inclusive and dynamic research environment and a reputation for transformative discoveries. In addition to our internally funded fellowships, there are a wide range of fellowships available from various funding bodies, charities and institutions, targeted at both early career researchers and mid to senior career researchers. If you are interested in Nottingham as your host institution please contact the fellowships team so that we can put you in touch with the appropriate contact in your host school/faculty. Most applicants for fellowships need to show strong institutional support for their application, so it is vital that you discuss your proposal as early as possible with your proposed host school/faculty. Please provide a CV and a brief research proposal to aid discussions. Alongside this, some fellowships have institutional restrictions on numbers we can submit, so please ensure that you discuss your proposal with the host school, and contact the fellowships team to find out more about internal sift processes. Contact us about our fellowships. Find answers to the questions we get asked the most regarding fellowships at the University of Nottingham. Results from the 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF2021) reaffirm Nottingham as among the best universities in the UK for the strength of our research."
