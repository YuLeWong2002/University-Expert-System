Students will have the flexibility to select a range of optional modules covering a diverse set of economics topics, as well as modules offered by other schools and departments across the University. The course provides students with a thorough understanding of economic theory and how it is applied to ‘real world’ situations. Students will be familiar with the key analytical techniques that economists use in practice. Our graduates are proven to be highly sought after in the job market. This is a single semester introductory module in macroeconomics. Macroeconomics is the study of the aggregate economy, focusing on the cyclical pattern of aggregate output and co-movement of real and monetary aggregates in general equilibrium. This module introduces a series of basic models used in modern macroeconomics, with a particular focus on dynamic general equilibrium modelling tools and techniques necessary to build theoretical models. This module is an introduction to microeconomics, including behaviour of firms and households in situations of competitive and imperfectly competitive markets. The first half of the module provides an introduction to the mathematical methods required for economic modelling, focusing on The second half introduces the statistical methods and concepts most applicable in economics. The analysis of economic data necessarily proceeds in an environment where there is uncertainty about the processes that generated the data. Statistical methods provide a framework for understanding and characterising this uncertainty. These concepts are most conveniently introduced through the analysis of single-variable problems. However, economists are most often concerned about relationships among variables. The module builds towards the study of regression analysis, which is often applied by economists in studying such relationships. Economic Integration 1 This module introduces you to the economics of integration. The module analyses the consequences for countries seeking closer economic integration through successively more ambitious forms. This begins with a limited trade arrangement, followed by a common market, which also allows free movement of capital and migrant workers, and a Single Market. The final part of the module examines monetary integration, beginning with exchange rate stabilisation and then considering Monetary Union. The module aims to combine principles of economic analysis with an assessment of the impact of such measures on the member economies. Economic Integration 2 This module introduces you to the economics of integration. It analyses the economic rationale for, and practice of, policy coordination and harmonisation both at the European and at a global level. An examination of the economic rationale for common EU policies is followed by an analysis of such examples as the common agricultural, trade and regional policies, and the operation of the European Budget. At the global level cooperation in trade, finance and development policies are reviewed in relation to the operation of institutions such as the World Trade Organisation, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The module aims to combine principles of economic analysis with an assessment of the impact of international policy coordination. This module explores current economic issues in Malaysia, economists' modelling of these issues, and potential policy responses. It covers the Malaysian economy's structure, trade and industrial policies, monetary and exchange rate policies, middle-income trap, budget deficit and debt, and subsidy rationalisation among others. This module examines the historical factors that have influenced the wealth of nations over the past 500 years. It delves into why some countries are wealthier than others and provides insights on promoting economic growth in developing nations. Drawing on recent economic literature, it analyses comparative development as a result of history and uses economic techniques to enhance our understanding of this process. This module explores how economics influences politicians and how politicians impact economics. It covers historical figures like Alexander Hamilton, Sir Robert Peel, the Meiji Emperor, Franklin D Roosevelt, Ludwig Erhard, Margaret Thatcher, and Deng Xiaoping, and their contributions to economic theory and practice. Topics include the role of the state in the economy, free trade, industrialisation, demand management, supply-side economics, monetarism, and growth and development strategies.

The University has everything a modern day student could wish for with the added bonus of being located in central Asia allowing you to travel further afield in your free time. Public transport is plentiful with free shuttle services operating on some routes. Taxi/Grab services in Malaysia are very reasonable and used widely by the student community. At The University of Nottingham Business School of Economics, we actively seek to develop our students' practical skills through a range of professional development programmes. We have developed industry links to enable students to network with top employers throughout their degrees via a range of activities. Graduates of the School of Economics in Malaysia have been employed by a large number of reputable banks such as Alliance Bank, CIMB, Citibank, JP Morgan, HSBC, Maybank, OCBC, UOB, Public Bank and RHB Investment Bank. Many students have gone on to work for multinational companies such as Axiata Group, Estée Lauder, Frank Knight, Frost & Sullivan, GlaxoSmithKline, IBM, PwC and Wolters Kluwer. Accolades and job roles have also been sought in policy institutions such as Asia Strategy, Leadership Institutions such as Khazanah Research Institute, Penang Institute, World Bank and government institutes including Bank Negara Malaysia, Malaysia Competition Commission, Maldives Ministry of Finance (Deputy Minister of Finance), MaGIC, Securities Commission. In addition, a substantial fraction of our graduates pursues their masters and doctoral studies around the world. Our 3-year honours degree is internationally recognised for entry into post-graduate programmes of renowned universities worldwide including University of Nottingham UK (including 1 with Chevening scholarship), London School of Economics, University College London, University of Warwick (including 1 with Chevening scholarship), University of Wyoming (including 1 direct entry into PhD programme with full scholarship) and Geothe University Frankfurt (PhD studentship). Students also pursue internships during the summer of their undergraduate programme where placements include: Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Nestle, Hewlett Packard, Khazanah, Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Ministry of Finance, PricewaterhouseCoopers Malaysia, PricewaterhouseCoopers Sri Lanka and The Maldives Monetary Authority. The duration of the economics undergraduate degree at UNM is 3 years, full-time. A BA degree in Economics usually includes more liberal arts subjects, such as humanities and the social sciences. A BSc Economics degree covers more courses in Mathematics and Statistics. This depends on your interests and the career that you want to pursue. An Economics degree is ideal for individuals who intend to work in investment banks, management consultancies, think-tanks, government agencies, and international policy institutions. This depends on the university you’re enrolled in. At UNM, students who are part of the BSc (Hons) Economics programme will have the opportunity to work with faculty members on research projects, participate in research studies and also conduct independent research. The curriculum for a Bachelor of Economics in Malaysia generally includes a mix of core courses, electives and a capstone project with a focus on economic principles and their applications. This is also true for UNM, where students are required to take core modules, optional modules and an economic dissertation in the third year. The cost of a BSc (Hons) in Economics at UNM is RM39,500 per year for Malaysian students and RM46,800 for International students. In addition to scholarships and loans offered by the government and organisations, UNM too, offers financial aid and scholarships to deserving students. It depends on the number of students enrolled. However, classes are typically small enough to facilitate close interaction between students and faculty members. Each student is also assigned one of the lecturers in the faculty as their personal tutor to address students’ concerns on a one-to-one basis. This content was last updated on 10 July 2024.
