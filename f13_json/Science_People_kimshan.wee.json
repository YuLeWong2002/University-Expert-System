Prior to this, I obtained my BSc degree from the National University of Singapore, NUS, in 2009, with a major in Life Sciences and a minor in Technopreneurship. I then conducted my PhD dissertation at NUS (2009-2013) on the \"genetic connectivity of four mangrove species from the Malay Peninsula\". Following this, I expanded my PhD work as a postdoctoral fellow (Apr-Jul 2014) at Chiba University (Japan) to include the global biogeography of key Asian mangrove species, before moving to the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden (China) for a fellowship supported by the Chinese Academy of Sciences to assess a genetically effective method of ex-situ conservation of threatened tree species (Aug 2014 - Dec 2015). From 2016 - 2020, I led the Ecological Genomics Team as an Associate Professor in the College of Forestry at Guangxi University (China). My core research interest is in the biogeography, adaptation and conservation of coastal ecosystems. My research has been supported by SEAMEO BIOTROP, the University of the Ryukyus, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, among others. My current research profile is firmly established on the biogeography, adaptation and conservation of coastal ecosystems (especially mangroves), with the primary goal of understanding theirâ€¦ read more telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8018"
