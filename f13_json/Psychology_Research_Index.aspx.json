Research methods involve using portable eye-tracking devices and video cameras explore aspects of gaze in complex environments. Staff: Dr Miflah Hussain Dr Neil Mennie We use multiple techniques (behavioural measures, eye-tracking, and ERPs) to conduct basic and applied research into human cognition and language, focusing on areas, such as bilingualism and multilingualism, language acquisition, recognition memory, word recognition, and speech perception. Dr Christine Leong Dr Jess Price Dr Alfred Lim Dr Soon Tat Lee Our research group studies a wide array of developmental outcomes and social-behavioural aspects across the lifespan (e.g., children, adolescents, youth, emerging adults), using a variety of methods (e.g., questionnaires, interviews, ethnography, experimental). We also examine contributing and interplaying factors, in addition to exploring cross-cultural differences. We aim to improve well-being of people at all ages holistically. Dr Chong Shue Ling Dr Lee Eun Hee Our research involves using evolutionary theory to shed light on the human mind and behaviour. We are particularly interested in the kinds of relationships people have with family vs. non-relatives, and whether this varies across cultures. In addition, we are interested in human sex differences. Our research aims to dissect the biological and cultural factors influencing the development of autobiographical memory across the lifespan. Another research aim is to examine the role of the psychological distance of positive and negative events in the development and maintenance of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Our research group studies the neurocognitive performance and neurobehavioural functioning in healthy and clinical population. Current research focuses on the area of ageing brains and their associated neuropsychological conditions. We are also developing methods that can help with early detection of age-related cognitive deficits and monitoring the progression of the deterioration. Dr Polly Chen Our research group aims to set up a library of assessment tools (formal and informal tests, survey questionnaires, neurocognitive assessments, etc.) for multilingual usage. Our work focuses on translation, cultural adaptation, validation and test-retest reliability of current tools to better suit local contexts. Dr Chong Shue-Ling Our research investigates various psychosocial factors that underlie the current issues associated with sustainability and liveability. Further, we aim to develop adequate solutions for the sustainable development of society by utilising various psychological methods. Our research investigates all aspects of how the human visual system provides us with information about the external world, with a particular focus on face recognition. In our research, we combine information from different sources, such as eye-tracking, EEG-ERP and classical behavioral and psychophysical paradigms.
