            "p": "The main focus of our research is to investigate: Current projects include research on sarcopenia and muscle regenerative potential from muscle derived stem cells (Prof Paul Loughna), the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis using in vitro models of equine articular cartilage (Prof Paul Loughna), bioinformatics and data-mining (Dr Richard Emes) and the molecular mechanisms behind neurodegenerative disease using a spontaneous mouse model of ataxia (Dr Lisa Chakrabarti) and retinal degeneration (Dr Lisa Chakrabarti, Dr Catrin Rutland). Studies to investigate lameness in cattle (Prof Jon Huxley) and the role of mechanotransduction in remodelling of musculoskeletal tissues are also being carried out by (Prof Paul Loughna, Dr Cyril Rauch) Example active projects in musculo-skeletal disease in SVMS: Title: In vitro models There are no results that match your criteria.
