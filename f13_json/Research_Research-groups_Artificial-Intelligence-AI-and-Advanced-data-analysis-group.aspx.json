            "p": "AI and machine learning techniques can help to create technological solutions to answer many different national and global challenges. Our cross-disciplinary team brings expertise in programming and algorithm development to applications in health and future food. Many of these techniques and skills are also applicable to the manufacturing sector, and the combination of advanced hardware and software, sensors and data analytics are expected to play a major role in driving the nation’s economic prosperity. Our major research strengths are directly aligned to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: Zero Hunger (goal 2), Good Health and Well-Being (goal 3) and Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure (goal 9). We develop and apply AI and machine learning techniques in various domains, particularly: Health and well-being Pushing boundaries in medicine and healthcare. Agritech Extending food quality and freshness through automated agricultural practices Our academic staff span the disciplines of computer science, biomedical science, pharmacy, biosciences and environmental science, with internationally recognised expertise in the following topic areas: Members of the group are actively involved in the Academy Science Malaysia, special interest group in AI and Machine Learning, and the Malaysia AI consortium. We welcome any potential collaboration with all relevant stakeholders, including industry, commercial organisations and other universities, including individual researchers. If you have ideas to discuss for collaborative research, consultancy or contract research, we’d be delighted to hear from you.
