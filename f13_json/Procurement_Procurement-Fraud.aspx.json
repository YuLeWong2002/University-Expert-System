            "p": "The University of Nottingham Malaysia would like to alert vendors to an active email ordering scam that involves requests for quotations, establishment of credit or submission of a purchase order, which purports to originate from the University but is in fact fraudulent. While the University cannot prevent this illegal activity, we can share with you some common traits of these fraudulent emails which may help reduce the risk to your company from falling victim to such a scam. Nevertheless, we encourage all vendors to exercise due diligence in verifying the accuracy of all orders at all times. As such, the University is not responsible for any losses caused by a vendor fulfilling a fraudulent order. We hope the below examples but not limited to, help your company decide how to identify and address such correspondences: • purchasing@nottingham-edu-my.com • finance@nottingham-edu-my.com If you wish to seek further clarification on the official UNM Purchase Order or suspect fraud in any way, please contact us immediately at 603-89248638 or via email procurement@nottingham.edu.my to verify its legitimacy before responding to the email or filling the order.
