            "p": "Currently, the school offers two undergraduate courses: BSc (Hons) Mathematics and Management, jointly with the Nottingham University Business School, and BSc (Hons) Mathematics and Data Science, jointly with the School of Computer Science. The courses provide a grounding in relevant mathematical concepts and techniques, combined with substantial degree-level studies in management or data science. The school forms a vital part of the theoretical preparation of students for their future professions in various branches of industry in particular engineering, management and data science. The school strives to train students by developing their computational and mathematical skills and educate the students in the tools, methods and strategies of solving real world problems. Even though teaching is our main responsibility, the faculty members are also engaged in inter-disciplinary research and development activities. The school strives to provide excellent teaching, research, and service to the university community and to the world in the application of mathematics to other disciplines.
