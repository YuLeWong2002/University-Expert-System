It is run by early-career researchers, for early-career researchers, ensuring a responsive and welcoming space is generated in order to nurture UNMC's dynamic early-research community. The ECRN hosts an annual ‘brown bag’ seminar series and workshop series. This initiative complements the work of the Graduate School by providing postgraduates, post-doctoral researchers and academics within the first five years of their careers with a platform to showcase, discuss, and gain feedback on their research from peers, colleagues and senior academics. It also creates an opportunity for professional skills training, networking and mentoring. The ECRN is designed to create a multidisciplinary space for academic discourse across the three faculties at UNMC: There are no results that match your criteria. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8001 email: ecrn@nottingham.edu.my"
