The Government intends that both will increase from the start of the 2025-26 academic year by 3.1% in line with inflation. The changes will apply to both new UK undergraduate students and those who are continuing their studies with us at the University of Nottingham. We want to explain what this will mean for you. Maintenance loans The Government has announced its intention to increase the maintenance loan cap for the 2025-26 academic year. This will apply to all students who qualify for a maintenance loan, with the highest levels of support being paid to students on household incomes of £25,000 or less. You can find out how much you will be eligible for on the Government website. Tuition fees The Government has also announced its intention to increase the tuition fee cap by 3.1% to £9,535 per year. Fees have not increased for seven years, which means they have not kept in line with inflation. This is an increase of £285 per year. The increase will not affect your monthly student loan repayments after finishing university. For a student loan, the amount you pay depends on how much you earn over the repayment threshold, not how much you borrowed during your studies. You can find out more detail about these changes on the Government website. We will keep you updated as more information becomes available.
