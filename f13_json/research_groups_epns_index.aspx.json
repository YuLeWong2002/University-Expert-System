            "p": "The English Place-Name Society (EPNS) was established in 1923 to conduct a county-by-county survey of the place-names of England. The first county survey of Buckinghamshire appeared in 1925. To date, the Survey has produced 91 volumes, the most recent being The Place-Names of Leicestershire Part VII, published in 2016. Almost all English counties have been surveyed at least in part and work to complete the Survey is ongoing. The Survey is used by researchers, academics, and those interested in the origins, meaning, and significance of English place-names. The Society always welcomes new members, both personal and institutional. In return for the annual subscription, full members receive free of charge the current issue of the Journal as well as the volume of the Survey allocated to that year's subscription. They are entitled to a concessionary price on any other available volume of the Survey. Associate members receive the Journal, and have some options on the Survey volumes.
