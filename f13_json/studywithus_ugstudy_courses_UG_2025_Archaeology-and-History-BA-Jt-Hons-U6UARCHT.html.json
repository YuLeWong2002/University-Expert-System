            "p": "University Park Campus, Nottingham, UK From the first hunter-gatherers to the complex societies of the medieval and modern periods, this course lets you study the past not just through texts and images but through material remains. You will explore the broadest range of periods through complementary disciplines. By combining the scientific study of material remains with historical research, writing and debate, you will cover the key ways we study the past. You will also deepen your knowledge of history through theory and practice, covering a range of periods from the Palaeolithic to the recent past. Our geographic reach is from Britain to the Far East and North America. You can investigate race, rights and propaganda and discover heroes and villains from the Middle Ages. Your studies can range from learning about evolution, culture and society through the study of bones, to the private lives of historical figures through letters. You will also gain practical experience of fieldwork and archaeological research in the UK and abroad. As a joint honours student, you will benefit from skills development and assessment methods from both subjects. Each subject is taught separately, but you can choose a uniting theme for your final year dissertation.

The reason I chose Archaeology and History combined is that it gave me the opportunity to study a wide range of history right from the prehistoric. This incorporates both archaeological skills and techniques as well as historical analysis. The course has given me a wide range of knowledge and has been such a fascinating and interesting combination. Plus, all the staff on both history and archaeology are always extremely helpful and kind.
