            "p": "Our MSc in Entrepreneurship, Innovation and Management requires high levels of participation and commitment and embodies a strong practical element to support the theoretical learning, giving our students the opportunity to learn how to apply their knowledge within organisations or towards starting a business venture. One of the most popular modules on the MSc is Entrepreneurial Creativity, run by Dr Chris Carter. The module is designed for budding entrepreneurs to understand, experience and explore the business planning process while learning how to use different theories and creative techniques to solve problems and generate new and innovative ideas. In the spirit of creativity, one of the assessment methods for the module is blog writing, and we asked a few of our current cohort to share their thoughts on what they learned about their own entrepreneurial creativity on the course.
