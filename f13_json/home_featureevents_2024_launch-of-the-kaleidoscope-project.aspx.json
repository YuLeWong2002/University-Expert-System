            "p": "As part of the university's celebration of diversity and commonality in this year's Inter Faith Week, the Faith and Chaplaincy Team will be launching a new project to help grow understanding with both staff and students. A personâ€™s religion or belief identity is multi-dimensional. Our individual lens on the world is composed of memories, emotions, cultures and personal journeys merging to form beautiful patterns and perspectives, just like a kaleidoscope. The new Kaleidoscope Project will partner you with someone of a different belief and support you to: Open to all students and staff of any faith or none. Sign up to receive your resource pack and be partnered up with your kaleidoscope buddy."
