Kuala Lumpur: An Exploration of the Subaltern Spaces and Figures of a Capital City This research takes a historical approach in striving to understand how Kuala Lumpur came into existence. By placing the poor and forgotten as the movers of the city's creation, it strives to provide an alternative narrative to the \"big men of history\" approach. 2. The Quasi-Populist Mobilisation of Conservative Malay-Muslim Social Movement: A Study of Perkasa and ISMA, 2008-2017 This dissertation discusses the factors (political opportunity) that brought about a conservative backlash in the Malaysian civil society between 2008 and 2017. It explores the relationships of two prominent Malay-Muslim NGOs with the state and how they might have employed populist strategies in mobilising their grassroots to collective action. 1. Place-making within the Peraktown Sikh Diaspora 2. Social Media and Political Communication Strategies in Thailand 3. Neither Here Nor There: The Uneven Modernisation of Malay Masculinity 4. Modernising Desire: The Malay Sentimental Public as a Politics of Space My research utilises Lacanian psychoanalysis to understand love in Malay popular culture in terms of cognitive mapping, wherein films offer a spatial imaginary to negotiate the contradictions of modernity. Key here is how masculinity - hegemonically deemed as the body of progress - is depicted in sentimental terms and its implications for the construction of a modern gender regime more broadly. telephone: +603 8924 8000 fax: +603 8924 8001 email: enquiries@nottingham.edu.my"
