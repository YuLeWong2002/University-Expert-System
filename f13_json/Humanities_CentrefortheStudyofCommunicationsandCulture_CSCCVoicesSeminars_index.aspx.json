            "p": "As a leading centre for research in the region and as part of a major project initiative, The Centre for the Study of Communications and Culture (CSCC) runs an annual 'Voices' seminar series under the general theme of Culture, Media and Identity. Each season comprises five to six lectures or multimedia presentations by renowned scholars and cultural activists. The main aim is to examine and evaluate the importance of culture and media in the construction of identities in an increasingly globalised world. This, we believe, is important in a region comprising multiple cultures and at a time when greater cultural awareness, understanding and respect is needed but not always forthcoming. All lectures or presentations are open to the public, and provide space for interaction and discussion from the audience. Visit the season pages (VI, VII & VIII) for more detail on what we've discussed so far. We also run regular seminars and forums from our campus in Semenyih under the umbrella title of 'Voices from the Hills'. These events, while intended primarily for an on-campus audience, are free of charge and open to the public - anyone is welcome to attend. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8693 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8020"
