This extends across a broad spectrum of international development, international relations and politics. Our research and teaching activities are enhanced by the resources from our associated schools in the UK and the Division of International Studies at the University of Nottingham Ningbo China. We host our own seminars in which academics and practitioners share their research findings and work experience. The school’s student society, PHIR-NOTT, supplements these formal activities with its own round-table discussions, guest speaker series and other events. International Relations investigates the complex relationships between and among states, societies, individuals, identities and cultures both theoretically and empirically. The discipline covers such areas as economics, law, politics and security. It considers deeper questions relating to how we understand and conceptualise contemporary global transformations. Throughout the programme, you will approach the subject from several different perspectives; from a state-centric approach, from the perspective of complex interdependence and from a globalisation perspective. The degree is open to students of any discipline or career background but is popular for those working in or wishing to work in a government or diplomatic service, international organisations or the media. We provide a dynamic learning environment that offers you the opportunity to challenge yourself, to question assumptions and to contribute to the way we understand, conceptualize and engage with global political phenomena. You will be required to complete 180 credits over the period of your studies: 120 credits of taught modules and a 60-credit dissertation, based on your own original research. The full-time and part-time evening class variant of the degree is taught at our city centre facility, The Kuala Lumpur Teaching Centre, at the Chulan Tower, Jalan Conlay – a great option for those based in Kuala Lumpur and in full-time employment.
