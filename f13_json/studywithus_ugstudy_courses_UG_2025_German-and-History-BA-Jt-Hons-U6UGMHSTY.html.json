We say, choose both! This joint honours course allows you to combine your curiosity for human experience with your love of communicating in another language. Many of our students say the year abroad is their course highlight. Not only do you have the opportunity to fully immerse yourself in the German language and culture, but spending time abroad can make you more independent and confident.
