            "p": "The majority of employees have been allocated a level in a job family, with the remaining in a number of staff groups. Your job family and level, or staff group, will be shown in your Statement of Terms and Conditions. If you do not know your job family or staff group please speak to your line manager. The annual leave entitlement is calculated on the basis of a “leave year”. The dates of the leave year are as stated in the contract of employment. For most staff in the University the leave year runs from 1 October to 30 September. For employees working in Digital and Technology Services, Estates & Facilities, Registry and Academic Affairs and Libraries the leave year runs from 1 January to 31 December. Up to 5 days / 36.25 hours"
