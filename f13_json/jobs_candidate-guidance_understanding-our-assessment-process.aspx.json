            "p": "In our recruitment process we may use a range of alternative assessment methods in addition to a structured interview that are designed to give you the opportunity to demonstrate your skills and abilities in different ways. Examples of assessments used in addition to a structured interview, depending on the type of role you are applying for, might include. For example; We may use a managerial scenario exercise for a role with management responsibilities. We use a variety of online assessments for you to demonstrate your skills and to assist managers in making selection decisions. You may be asked to complete this type of assessment prior to attending your interview depending on the role you are applying for. Examples include: If we are using an online assessment, you will be asked to complete this prior to attending the interview. You will receive instructions in your invitation to interview and it is important that you complete it by the given deadline. A helpful guide will be shared with you to explain more about the assessment you have been asked to do and to help you know what to expect before you start. Prior to beginning the assessment, you will have the option to take a practise test to familiarise yourself with the process."
