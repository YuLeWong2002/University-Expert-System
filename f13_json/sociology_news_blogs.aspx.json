It is a forum to encourage dialog about issues related to mental health. Our aim is to capture the variety of interest and expertise that is reflected in the Institute's diverse membership body. This blog promotes discussion of topics related to the research programme 'Making Science Public: Challenges and Opportunities'. Our purpose is not to 'make science public'. Instead, we want to study the opportunities that have emerged for science to be more openly practiced and debated, but also the challenges posed by making science public or by promoting the making public of science as a solution to a variety of problems in society and in politics. This blog will report on these and other issues related to the Leverhulme funded research programme: Making Science Public: Challenges and Opportunities.
