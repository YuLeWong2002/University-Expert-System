            "p": "All of our seminars are typically in a hybrid format; they are hosted in the Seminar Room of the Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre (University Park) with the option to join in via Microsost Teams. Please note that some international speakers may be presenting from their home country, and therefore may not be hosted in the Seminar Room. The times of our talks are usually 13:00 GMT/BST for UK/EU based speakers and 15:00 GMT/BST for USA based speakers. Although we will try to keep this list up to date, if you need further information then please contact either Henry Bowler and Louise Cowell. Join our mailing list for announcements about our seminars. Titles for the following talks will be confirmed closer to the schedule seminar. Dates for these seminars may be altered at any point."
