Late Submission of Extenuating Circumstances : revised guidance on the late submission of extenuating circumstances was approved by Learning and Teaching Committee in February, to be effective immediately. The guidance has been revised to state: â€˜Schools are entitled to reject automatically and without consideration all extenuating circumstances claims that are submitted after the relevant marks or qualification outcomes have been published to students. The only exception to this provision is where the student provides authoritative evidence (e.g. from a doctor) that they were clinically unable to submit the extenuating circumstances any earlier.' Updates to the Assessment Section of the Quality Manual 1. The section on Rounding within the Marking and Grading guidance has been amended to provide more clarity. 2. Examples of Marking Schemes are available in the Good Practice Guide. Schools are encouraged to forward copies of marking schemes using the full range of marks (including categories above 70% and below 40%) to Sandra Mienczakowski for inclusion in the Guide. 3. Following the acceptance of recommendations from the Marking and Classification Working Group by Learning and Teaching Committee, the following updates have been made to the Quality Manual to be implemented for students registering on programmes from the 2009/10 academic year onwards: i) Use of Borderlines :http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/quality-manual/assessment/degree-class.htm Schools should use a weighted profiling system for determining the degree class of borderline students and this should be made explicit and clear to students at the start of their studies through School Handbooks. Examples of profiling systems are available in the Good Practice Guide and Schools are encouraged to forward copies of profiling systems already in use to Sandra Mienczakowski for inclusion in the Guide. ii) Approved degree classification weightings : http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/quality-manual/taught-programmes/programme-specifications.htm A list of approved degree classification weightings has been added to the Programme Specification Guidance. The use of these weightings in degree calculation should be applied to students commencing their studies in 2009/10 and graduating from 2011/2012. iii) Use of Vivas : http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/quality-manual/assessment/marking.htm . Further guidance on the use of individual vivas for borderline candidates on taught programmes has been added to the section on Viva Voce Examinations.
