            "p": "The School of Politics and International Relations is rated highly by students for the excellence of its teaching. The learning experience in PIR is characterised by small class sizes which means that you get more time with your lecturers than at many other institutions. You will also be allocated a personal tutor from whom you can seek advice on careers, module choices and other academic matters. We also help our students to develop outside the classroom with a range of internship opportunities and study abroad programmes. You can also read more on what our students say . . . Undergraduate Rebecca McKeown talks about her experience studying International Relations with German at the Malaysia Campus. Study abroad at another Nottingham Campus in the UK or China - or explore more options with one of our exchange partners in North America, Australia or Europe. We offer a range of internship opportunities for students in the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences - a great way for students to gain work experience and learn something new.
