            "p": "The school would like to say well done to Zayed Mohammed J Alziyadi, who has successfully defended his thesis today and passed with minor corrections. Zayed's research focussed on school leadership development in Saudi Arabia: Policy-makers’ and participants’ perspectives. Zayed produced a strong written research project focused on leadership development in the context of secondary schools for boys in Saudia Arabia. He defended his thesis in an enthusiastic and positive manner, and both Zayed and his supervisor, Professor Tony Bush, were ecstatic with the outcome! The viva was chaired by Dr Marc North, Professor Toby Greany had the role of internal examiner, with Dr Waheed Hammad acting as external examiner. A great day for Zayed who will return to Saudia Arabia shortly to resume work with the Ministry of Education, and is hopeful about continuing his research to investigate whether the same findings apply in schools for girls in Saudia Arabia. Congratulations Zayed."
