It's about people and purpose. It's an approach to marketing that serves true human needs. Not the other way around. That's why everything we do for brands is designed with a human purpose in mind. A brand without a purpose is one that will never be understood or embraced by people. A brand with purpose can be a true agent of change and transform the way people think, feel or act. Our dream is to be the best creator of ideas that truly moves people - bar none. Leo Burnett summer school internship programme allows student to gain experience in working as an account handler or account planner where students will have the opportunity to work on high profile accounts.
