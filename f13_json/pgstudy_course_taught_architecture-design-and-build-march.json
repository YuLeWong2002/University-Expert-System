            "p": "Our Architecture Design and Build programmes focus on the relationships between design and the physical creation of space. Our programme will explore the nature of making and production as they relate to architectural design and practice. The programme is designed to ensure that students have the opportunity to learn about architecture by making, to understand materials through hands-on exploration in their application, and ultimately to develop a critical response to the implications of design decisions on people and places. Within the programme, you will be able to develop design ideas at 1:1 scale and the integration with architecture student’s from varying backgrounds and experience levels. and 5th in the UK for Architecture QS World University Rankings by Subject 2023 in the Russell Group universities for ‘overall satisfaction’ in Architecture The National Student Survey 2022 in Architecture Times Good University Guide 2023 This programme comprises a series of design projects, skill-based workshops and research seminars, through which you may investigate technologies in an interdisciplinary manner to provide innovative solutions that are supported by appropriate technical evidence, testing and modelling. You will spend the summer semester producing a supervised dissertation. This will be an in-depth study of an individually determined topic and is your opportunity to conduct a major piece of independent research that reflects your interests and aspirations. By focusing on the contemporary challenges and opportunities in building design, you will develop a solid understanding of issues such as: The purpose of this module is to develop architectural, urban design skills and awareness through the design of architectural and urban interventions at an appropriate scale and resolution, in response to a brief. Students are encouraged to engage with a specific design specialism, to adopt novel approaches to the generation of design concepts, and to develop these in detail in response to the circumstances of both the physical, cultural and intellectual context of the project. This is a studio-based design module within a specialist design units (for example: architecture design, museum design, tall buildings, sustainable architecture design, architectural tectonics, sustainable urban design). The projects will involve the design of an architectural or urban intervention at an appropriate scale and resolution in response to an advanced design brief. The module provides higher-level skills and understanding necessary for postgraduate study within specialist streams and explores the integration and development of advanced specialist concepts, ideas, technologies and thinking within the architectural and urban design environment. Throughout the semester, students are expected to undertake in-depth conceptual development, design research, design testing and evaluation, and final presentation.

Throughout the semester, students are expected to undertake in-depth conceptual development, design research, design testing and evaluation, presentation and communication. The Case Study Project is a module focused on learning from existing buildings and/or urban spaces through post-occupancy and performance monitoring and evaluation. The module offers opportunities for students to explore environmental design issues in depth, to further develop their preferred speciality and to develop academic writing skills. Much of the work produced in this module has been published in international conferences or journals. Design and Build Theory and Practicum gives a thematic background of the specialisation that is design/build in architecture This module is intended as a theoretical grounding in the practice of design+build as a means of investigating architecture and design. The module will enable an advanced understanding of new and alternative approaches to practising architecture. The traditions of designer-makers will be explored, including the professionalisation of architecture, and the emerging trends in the discipline leading to alternative practices This module aims to module aims to explore the nature of design-build as an educational practice, including its emergence from 1960’s radical pedagogical movements and its evolution into an accepted dimension of architectural education. This will include tracing the origins of design+build, and its relationship with the discipline and profession of Architecture and the emergence of Architect led design+build as an alternative to established means of practice as defined by the RIBA and AIA This module is intended as an introduction to the themes ideas and practices involved in the emerging field of architectural fabrication. It will cover traditional and digital approaches, and the steps and skills needed to use fabrication as a design tool and as a design output. This module aims to analyse the process of design fabrication, understanding the tools and methods at the disposal of the designer-maker and the process(es) needed to support the fabrication of design ideas. The module will explore the process of design and how it can be shaped through an understanding of fabrication processes and potentials. This module enables students to acquire the core skills used in research and practice these through an exploration of a specialist subject relevant to architecture and the built environment. This module covers the skills and resources needed to conduct independent academic research, including how to present findings effectively. It will cover choosing a research topic, how to shape research literature search techniques, including the use of the web. As a result, students will be able to conduct their own primary research, including quantitative and qualitative methodologies; data collection and simple statistical analysis. Opportunities to practice these skills will be presented through participation in a mixture of lectures, seminars and workshops designed to introduce specialist subject areas relevant to the field of architecture and related disciplines. This module aims to enable students to plan, implement and write up a substantial piece of original research that will make a contribution to the intellectual life of the discipline. Students can choose between a research dissertation or a design thesis project in the Summer term. The dissertation module aims to enable students to plan, implement, and write up a substantial piece of original research that will make a contribution to the intellectual life of the discipline of urban design. The dissertation seeks to enable students to: The design thesis project module is a research and studio-based module that aims to further develop advanced level design skills and knowledge. The structured project within the module builds upon the design, practical, and theoretical modules in the Autumn and Spring semesters and involves the completion of a detailed thesis design solution that should reflect the investigative research that is conducted through a written design research report. The design thesis project will enable students to: Assessment is based on coursework presented either as a portfolio, architecture work, or written submissions. This course requires individual and group work. You will be expected to work both in and outside of studio and seminar modules. As a guide, one credit is equal to approximately 10 hours of work. Studios can be vertically integrated, and you may be involved with projects that include undergraduate students. Build projects are often “extra-curricular” and cannot be guaranteed due to the nature of working on real projects. Travel for international design/build work is encouraged, but as it is an added expense is not a requirement of the course. Teaching for this course usually takes place on Tuesdays and Fridays during term-time. This is subject to timetabling and depends on which optional modules you choose. All candidates are considered on an individual basis and we accept a broad range of qualifications. The entrance requirements below apply to 2025 entry. Applicants to all MArch programmes are required to submit a portfolio of their design work with their application. The portfolio enables us to see that you have some of the core skills required to be successful on an MArch course and to see the range of skills and types of projects that you have completed in your undergraduate degree. The portfolio should be submitted with your admissions application and be in PDF format and less than 10Mb (please submit this directly onto the MyNottingham admissions system). The portfolio should have: The portfolio should contain: Portfolios will be judged on whether you have the visual skills required together with a keen sense of judgement and spatial awareness in your work.
