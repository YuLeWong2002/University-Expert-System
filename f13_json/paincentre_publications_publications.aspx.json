            "p": "The multidisciplinary and translational strategy of Pain Centre Versus Arthritis has continued to sustain a high volume of novel research outputs. Our Patient and Public Advisory Group has also continued to help us to communicate our findings to a wider public through lay summaries of scientific publications on our website. We also combine individual patient experience and perspective, obtained through Patient and Public Involvement and qualitative research, with an understanding of societal need. This broader perspective is, in part, gained through the epidemiological analysis of Cohort data collected by the Centre, including our Knee Pain and related health In the Community (KPIC) cohort and Investigating Musculoskeletal Health and Wellbeing (IMH&W) cohort.
