            "p": "It is essential that the University has a coordinated approach to the installation or expansion of all University installed intruder alarm, CCTV and Door access systems. This ensures that, we use the preferred supplier and that equipment is compatible with existing installations. The Estates Security Section, together with our Communications Engineer will be happy to meet, and if necessary, conduct a site visit for anybody who is involved in the installation or expansion of any such system. The Security Office can be contacted on 0115 9513557. E-Mail: security@nottingham.ac.uk. The University of Nottingham University Park Nottingham, NG7 2RD"
