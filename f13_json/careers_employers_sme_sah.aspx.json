            "p": "The Skills Access Hub was a European Social Fund (ESF) project managed by Nottingham City Council between 2020 and 2023. The University of Nottingham Careers and Employability Service delivered advice and guidance to local businesses, along with recruitment subsidies, aiming to improve graduate recruitment, retention and development in Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. Our project focused on upskilling local businesses in their approach to recruiting talent from local colleges and universities. This included opportunities to have job descriptions reviewed, receive support for developing recruitment and selection activities as well as brand awareness raising. The university strand of the Skill Access Hub was a huge success â€“ 130 businesses officially enrolled on the programme with dozens more receiving advice from the university. 449 individuals went through a training programme delivered by the university and 97 organisations completed project closure reports. All of the key performance indicators set through the ESF programme for the university were set or exceeded. telephone: +44 (0) 115 82 32233 fax: +44 (0) 115 951 3679 email: recruiterservices@nottingham.ac.uk"
