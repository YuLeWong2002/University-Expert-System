            "p": "Student IT accounts provide access to the following services: An IT account is issued to each new student as part of the registration process. You will first need to activate your IT account to retrieve your official university username and temporary password. You will be given the chance to change your password during the activation. Once you have activated your IT account, you can login to NottinghamHub with the same username and password to complete your online registration as a student. IT account holders can manage their own password. When you change your password for one service, your password will automatically change for other services too. If you have not completed the password security questions and answers, please contact IT Service Desk. All students must take full responsibility for activity within their IT account and adhere to the Code of Practice. Account owners are requested to take appropriate care with their account details/passwords. telephone: +603 8924 8199 fax: +603 8924 8007 email: itservicedesk@nottingham.edu.my"
