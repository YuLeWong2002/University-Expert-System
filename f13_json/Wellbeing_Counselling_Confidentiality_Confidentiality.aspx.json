            "p": "The University Counselling Service is confidential. This means that we do not disclose verbal or written information without your permission or agreement. In rare cases, disclosure may occur without your consent if there is good reason to believe that you or others are at risk. Question: \"Will you keep my problem a secret?\" Answer: \"Yes.\" Brief notes are kept in a secure place only within the Counselling Service. As a core aspect of everyday practice, counsellors understand both the legal and ethical implications of providing confidentiality and of keeping records concerning their clients. As such all notes are recorded in short factual notes, and stored in a secure, locked place within the Service. If you would like further clarification about the way the University Counselling Service works, please discuss this with your frontline counsellor. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8001"
