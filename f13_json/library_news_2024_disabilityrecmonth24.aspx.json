We asked students and staff for recommendations of works that explore disability to broaden our collection and make it more inclusive. With those suggestions we created a dedicated reading list for Disability Recognition Month that features a wide range of titles, covering essays, memoirs and fiction, alongside a selection of webpages and magazines. It's the perfect place to find your next great read or even for research into a project. Many titles from the reading list are available to borrow from our libraries in print or ebook format. Click through on the reading list to check availability on NUsearch and place requests. Do you have a favourite book you'd like to share with us? We're expanding our Disabiltiy Recognition Month reading list and need your help, if you have a book suggestion you'd like us to add to our collection, send it our way.
