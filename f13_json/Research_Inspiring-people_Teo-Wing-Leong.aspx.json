            "p": "The biggest challenge involves how to capture important transmission channels (such as financial sector) of short-run fluctuations in the model. Currently, a PhD student is working on studying the effects of remittance in an economy which is dependent on oil imports, and yet the remittance itself may be dependent on the oil price. This is the situation faced by countries such as Pakistan. My undergraduate students are working on topics such as the effects of Covid-19 on stock prices, China's One Belt One Road Initiative, Malaysia’s Housing Price, Female Labour Force Participation Rate etc for their final year dissertations. I aim to investigate the relations between different time horizons (short run, medium run, long run) and how policies should be designed keeping in mind the connections of the different time horizons. Economic fluctuations and economy policies both have far-reaching impacts on everyone’s life, so I am motivated to contribute to research that increases our understanding on these two broad topics. Involved in helping policy makers to develop their own models that are used in actual policy discussions. I hope my research will help contribute to discussions on appropriate policies for different economies. Good collaborators not only complement our strengths, but in the process of discussions and collaborations, more new ideas can emerge and often can lead to more output. Always remember the motivation behind the research and keep working to achieve your goals. View full profile telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8034 email: rke.hub@nottingham.edu.my"
