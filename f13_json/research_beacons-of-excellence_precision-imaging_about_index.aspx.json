            "p": "The University of Nottingham is the home of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This pioneering invention continues to transform lives and medical care across the world. MRI, which grew from an idea in the physics department 40 years ago, is now used in more than 60 million clinical examinations around the world every year. The Precision Imaging Beacon is one of six Beacons of Excellence of the University of Nottingham. It aims to become an internationally leading centre for imaging in precision medicine with a focus in chronic mental and physical health disorders which are major causes of disability. Building on Nottinghamâ€™s heritage (birthplace of MRI) and reputation in biomedical imaging, we are spearheading the development of highly innovative imaging tools as a gateway to effective personalised treatment. The Precision Imaging Beacon is formed by a team of world-leading experts from eight centres of excellence: the SPMIC, NIHR Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre, IMH (Institute of Mental Health) Versus Arthritis Pain Centre, Versus Arthritis Sports & Exercise Centre, MRC/Versus Arthritis Centre for Musculo-Skeletal Ageing, Centre for Kidney Research and Innovation, and the Centre for Mathematical Medicine and Biology. Our research programme makes use of recent transformational advances in imaging technology, big data analytics and biophysical modelling that together can solve complex diagnostic needs in precision medicine. We bringing together researchers who develop novel medical imaging techniques with clinicians and scientists who use them.
