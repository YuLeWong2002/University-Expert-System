            "p": "Assistant Professor, I worked briefly as a contract researcher for Institute for Medical Research (Kuala Lumpur) from 2006-2008. I completed my MSc in Industrial Chemistry from Universiti Malaysia Pahang in 2012. My teaching career started with Curtin University Sarawak from 2009 to 2016. Currently I'm working with University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus as a foundation chemistry lecturer. My research interest predominantly focus on natural products drug discovery. I hope I can contribute my expertise in plant drugs discovery which includes natural products isolation, bioactivity assessment and chemical structure elucidation. My MSc works had provided some insights about antidiabetic properties of Borapetol B, a clerodane diterpene compound. I wish I can extend the investigation by focusing on how clerodane diterpenes' insulin inducing mechanism takes place in pancreatic beta cell. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8001"
