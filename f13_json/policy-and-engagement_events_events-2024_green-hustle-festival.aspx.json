            "p": "This fantastic one-day event returns to Nottingham city centre in June! The festival features activities, creative workshops, a talks tent, live music, street entertainment, a pop up garden, and a community cafe serving pay-what-you-feel meals. Green Hustle will bring an inspiring programme right into the heart of the city featuring collaborations with local artists, organisations and community groups, uniting behind the theme ‘Common Ground’. It's a great way to find out more about green issues and take away ideas for sustainable living, from making ethical purchases and tips for growing in pots and plots of all sizes, to steps individuals can take to effect change in their communities. The Institute for Policy and Engagement is proud to once again support this great festival and share some of Nottingham’s latest research through this popular community event! Discover more about the two community, research project we are funding as part of the celebrations in our recent Green Hustle blog. University Park Nottingham NG7 2RD t: +44 (0) 115 951 5151 e: theinstitute@nottingham.ac.uk"
