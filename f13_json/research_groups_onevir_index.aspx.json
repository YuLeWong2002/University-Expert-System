            "p": "Welcome to One Virology. We’re a ground-breaking, interdisciplinary team of researchers based in the School of Veterinary Medicine, bringing together expertise to make new discoveries, deepen scientific understanding and pioneer novel approaches to challenging human and veterinary virus infections. Historically, virologists across the university focused separately on virus infections within human health and veterinary medicine, mainly aligned to their school specialisms. In 2014, we decided to come together to achieve even more. This led to a successful bid to the Wolfson laboratory refurbishment scheme and formation of the Wolfson Centre for Global Virus Research, led by Professor Jonathan Ball. The centre is made up of around 16 principal investigators and around 40 postdoctoral researchers, technicians and postgraduate students from across the schools of Veterinary Medicine and Science, Life Sciences and Biosciences. The One Virology group has benefited from this harnessing of combined expertise to create fresh perspectives, drive exciting projects and make important breakthroughs. On these pages, you can: Explore the range of viruses we study within One Virology and find out about our collaborations and publications. To find out more about how our research makes an impact, explore the group’s research themes and projects. From Ebola to Zika, we’re developing strategies for dealing with some of the most potentially devastating viruses on the planet. We’re deepening our understanding of disease resistance to unlock new prevention and treatment possibilities. Latest news Twitter"
