            "p": "Castle Meadow Campus Design Team Bond Bryan Architects Completion Autumn 2024 One of the seven buildings located in Nottingham city centre, Building F, formerly known as 'Yorke House', forms part of the University of Nottinghamâ€™s Castle Meadow Campus. The proposed refurbishment works to this structure comprise the creation of a new dedicated entrance and full refurbishment throughout the existing four-storey building, to facilitate the operational needs of its new intended use as office accommodation for the University of Nottingham Innovation Park (UNIP). Full refurbishment will be carried out on the existing building, for use as rentable office facilities for business partners. Typical user group sizes will range from a two-person office, up to 125-person office facilities. Rentable office facilities to include secure office space (i.e. an enclosed room with a lockable door), open plan desks and hot desks. Each floor shall include shared break-out spaces, such as relaxation areas and informal meeting areas. There will be formal meeting rooms, kitchenettes and WC facilities. Careful consideration has been given to the existing building fabric, both in response to the original design ethos and the physical condition of the original building materials, some 30 years after completion. One key design driver is the existing heating and ventilation strategy, which currently utilises the raised access floors as air plenums at each floor level and ventilation at roof level, to naturally ventilate the building. These existing systems are to be utilised where possible and practical."
