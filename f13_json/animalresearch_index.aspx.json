            "p": "Research involving animals has made, and continues to make a vital contribution to understanding, treating and curing many major 21st century health problems, including cancer, heart disease, diabetes and mental illness. New methods have enabled scientists and medical researchers to reduce work involving animals, but some animal studies must continue for further progress in science and medicine. Research programmes at the University of Nottingham are of the highest quality and only use animals when there are no alternatives. This research is carried out using specialised facilities and expertise. The excellent culture of care is underpinned by a commitment to the principles of the 3R's.
