The war had shown a need for close cooperation between Red Cross Societies, which, through their humanitarian activities on behalf of prisoners of war and combatants, had attracted millions of volunteers and built a large body of expertise. A devastated Europe could not afford to lose such a resource. Position background: The internship is established to support the IFRC Migration Unit. The IFRC Migration Unit provides expert support and capacity building to 38 Red Cross Red Crescent National Societies across the Asia Pacific region, to work with and for vulnerable migrants. National Societies strive to provide assistance and protection to migrants, uphold their rights and dignity, empower them in their search for opportunities and sustainable solutions, as well as promote social inclusion and interaction between migrants and host communities. The duration of the internship is three (3) to six (6)-months. Note: This internship is aimed at School of Politics, History and International Relations (PHIR) third year and PGT students.
