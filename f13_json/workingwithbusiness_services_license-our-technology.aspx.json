            "p": "We have extensive experience of working with businesses to help them license innovative technologies developed here at The University of Nottingham. Our academic and research staff are working to develop new ideas and technologies, many of which have opportunities for commercial applications. We are always keen to meet with businesses that would like to partner with us to develop these ideas. Many companies have successfully and profitably licensed our technologies in areas such as medicine, engineering, mining, cosmetics, food & drink, building and IT. A list of technologies currently available for licensing can be found here."
