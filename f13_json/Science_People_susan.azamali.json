            "p": "Honorary Associate Prof, I graduated from the University of Nottingham in 1986 with a BSc (Hons) in Agricultural Sciences (Nutrition). Followed by a PhD in 1990 (from the University of Nottingham) in nutritional biochemistry - on the nutritional evaluation of cassava. After time spent as a volunteer on nutrition-related projects in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, I joined the Intermediate Technology Development Group (now Practical Action) as an Agro Processing Specialist. Project work over the next 8 years increased my experiences of overseas development work, in Asia and Africa. I worked as a Consultant in Agro Processing for 10 years, before joining the University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus (UNMC) to establish the Nutrition degree programme. I now combine consultancy work for FAO and other development agencies, with academic work at UNMC. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8018"
