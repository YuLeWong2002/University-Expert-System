            "p": "New research from the University of Nottingham has highlighted that increased cultural burning by Indigenous Australians prevented high-intensity fires for millennia. Forest fires are projected to increase in the coming years, as a result of anthropogenic climate change – climate change directly caused by human activity. Understanding the linkages between climate change, human activity and fires is important to plan for successful management of fire-prone landscapes, such as Australia’s. The new research, published in Science, highlights how the intensity of forest fires in fire-prone southeastern Australia decreased over time alongside an increase in Indigenous populations.
