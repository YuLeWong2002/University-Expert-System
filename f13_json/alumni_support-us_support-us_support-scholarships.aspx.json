But too many bright students from disadvantaged backgrounds find barriers are in their way.

Donate today and you can help students from all backgrounds say 'yes' to their university dream. You can make a real difference to the lives of bright prospective students, giving them the confidence to choose Nottingham, whatever their background. 9 people giving £10 a month, will give a talented student a Nottingham Potential Scholarship for one year. Make your gift today Every year there are many incredibly talented individuals that would benefit from a scholarships but miss out due to demand. Thanks to generous donations already receieved, 1,655 students have secured a Nottingham Potential Scholarship since 2015 and were able to start their university journey. But we need your help in order to be able to give more students the help they need to unlock their potential here at Nottingham. Without the scholarship I wouldn’t have been able to go to university. It’s only thanks to help that people like me can live up to their hopes and dreams in the future. The cost of living is extremely high and there are some disadvantaged students such as myself who just wouldn't be able to afford it without the help of others.
