You will investigate the culture and history of ancient Greece and Rome by examining texts in their original language. Immerse yourself in ancient speeches, drama, epic, and satire in the original Greek or Latin, and explore how language and culture inform one another. Reading ancient texts in their original Latin or Greek is one of the greatest pleasures of studying Greek and Roman culture. You can learn either language from scratch, or build on your existing knowledge. Studying Latin and ancient Greek will give you greater insight into the texts you’re reading in translation. You can combine modules on the history, art, and culture of the ancient Mediterranean with detailed study of both Latin and Greek. Learning an ancient language also builds skills in linguistic analysis and literacy that are valued by employers.
