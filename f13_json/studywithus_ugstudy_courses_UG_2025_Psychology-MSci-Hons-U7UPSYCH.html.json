            "p": "University Park Campus, Nottingham, UK Psychology is the scientific study of mental processes. You'll learn about the structure of the brain as well as the perceptions, thoughts, feelings and actions of people. In years one and three, you'll have optional modules to choose from (which, in year one, can be from outside psychology, to explore other areas). This is your chance to explore the areas of psychology that you find interesting. As we have experts from across the spectrum of psychology, we are able to offer you a choice from many different areas in both theoretical and applied psychology. For example, you can explore topics including forensic or clinical psychology, cognitive neuroscience, neuroimaging and neuropsychology, or social, educational and developmental psychology. As a psychology student you will also be able to apply to our Pschology Insights project, which gives you the opportunity to work on a live brief with a local organisation. Hear from students who have taken part before and find out more about this career accelerating experience. Mandatory Year 1 Biological Psychology Cognitive Psychology 1 Developmental Psychology Introduction to Research Methods and Analysis Practical Methods and Seminars in Psychology Social Psychology Optional Addiction and the Brain Psychological Approaches to Therapy The above is a sample of the typical modules we offer, but is not intended to be construed or relied on as a definitive list of what might be available in any given year.

Lecture classes can be between 30-300 students. Laboratory classes typically include 30-60 students. Seminar groups and tutorial groups are usually made up of 10-12 students. Modules are typically delivered by professors, associate professors or assistant professors. PhD students may support laboratory demonstrations and report marking and feedback.
