            "p": "The D H Lawrence Collections at The University of Nottingham Library form one of the major international research resources for the study of D H Lawrence (1885-1930), the well-known Nottinghamshire born writer, who was briefly a student at University College Nottingham in the early 20th century. The collections include printed editions of his writings, literary manuscripts, correspondence by and about him, a small number of artworks, newspaper cuttings, reports, photographs and a wealth of supporting secondary sources. Researchers now come to Nottingham from all over the world to consult the collections and detailed catalogues of both published and unpublished materials are now available with the support of the Heritage Lottery Fund. A range of supporting material related to Lawrence and his work are also provided online to enhance the understanding of his works both for serious students and general readers. These resources do not, at the moment, provide direct access to digital versions of the full texts of his writings or personal papers, nor any critical essays or studies of individual works. Regular exhibitions relating to Lawrence and his work have been mounted in the Weston Gallery in the D H Lawrence Pavilion, part of the University's Lakeside Arts Centre, and versions of these exhibitions are being made available as online exhibitions on this web site. See also our learning resource, Odour Chrysanthemums: a text in progress. This offers researchers the opportunity to study four different versions of the DH Lawrence short story, and trace the changes made to the text.
