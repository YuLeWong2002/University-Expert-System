The skills, motivation and life experience they bring is valued across our communities. Being a mature student can give you an advantage at university, but we understand it can also be a big decision to return to study. Luckily, there is plenty of support on offer for anyone who is over the age of 21 when enrolling on an undergraduate course, and to help students returning to education after a long break. On this page you'll find all of the support and resources that have been specifically designed for mature students, but don't forget that it doesn't have to have a 'mature students' label on it for you to use it. Whether it's disability support, academic skills or career and employability services, you have access to the same opportunities as any other student. If you're a postgraduate mature student (over the age of 24) make sure you visit our postgraduate pages as well.
