The University of Nottingham has a fantastic range of sports clubs to choose from - whatever you're interested in, there will be something for you! Our clubs represent the University of Nottingham in our Green and Gold kit, but several offer beginner and social sessions alongside their competitive teams. You can use the club A-Z finder on the page to find more information about each sports club. Many clubs host tasters and assessment days at the beginning of the academic year and during Refreshers (highlighted below) but there's often opportunities to get involved throughout the season.
