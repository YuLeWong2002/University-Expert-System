The centre is named in honour of Professor Sir Clive Granger (1934-2009) in recognition both of his invaluable contributions to the discipline of time series econometrics and his long association with the University of Nottingham. Sir Clive, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 2003, had a profound influence in the field of time series analysis over almost half a century, becoming one of the most prominent econometricians in the world. He died on May 27, 2009, at Scripps Memorial Hospital in San Diego, California. He leaves a legacy of research and analysis that will continue to be important for years to come.
