            "p": "The aerospace industry is growing at a phenomenal rate. It’s estimated that by 2030, there will be around 27,000 new aircraft in the skies, worth around $3.7tn. The UK already has the world’s second largest aerospace sector – and global demand is accelerating. The government has pledged to invest £1bn, matched by industry, to facilitate continued development and enable the country to benefit economically and socially from the industry – with limited impact on the environment. This is complemented by European investment of €4bn through the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking and Horizon2020 research and innovation programmes. To support the industry, we set up the Institute for Aerospace Technology (IAT). Today, the facility is home to a 400-strong team of leading researchers delivering innovative, multidisciplinary research expertise. It’s driving the development of cutting-edge technology that will radically improve all aspects of air transport. IAT is a partner of choice in our five key areas of research: We’re always searching to discover the next innovation within aerospace by bringing people and projects together. If you share our ambition and drive for smarter, greener and faster aircraft, we’d like to hear from you."
