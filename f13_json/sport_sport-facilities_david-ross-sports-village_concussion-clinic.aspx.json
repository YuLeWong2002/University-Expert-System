            "p": "Our Concussion Clinic can help support you during your concussion injury and help you to return to learning and daily life activities and to return to your sporting activities. Concussion is a common brain injury that can occur during sporting participation and from injuries in every day life. People with a concussion injury can described various symptoms but the common complaints are headache, difficulty with concentration, irritability and insomnia. The majority of concussion cases usually resolve within 7-10 days but in 10-15% of cases, symptoms can persist for longer than this. During a Concussion Clinic appointment, you will undergo a sport concussion assessment (SCAT-5) and you will be assessed by Dr Mary Oâ€™Hanlon who will give you advice if you are ready to return to sporting participation. We can see you in our clinic just after your concussion to give you advice during your rest period and when to start the graduated return to play (GRTP). If you have already started your return to play, we can provide the final clearance to resume full sporting activities which can only be undertaken by a Doctor. Our Concussion Clinic takes place on Monday's 9:30am - 12:30pm. We have a team of expert clinicians on hand ready to deal with your enquiries, bookings and to help shape your pathway to recovery. Arranging an appointment with the Sports Injury Clinic could not be simpler. To book: Sports massage sessions can now be booked through our online booking portal. +44 (0)115 748 7000 sport@nottingham.ac.uk Find our opening times here."
