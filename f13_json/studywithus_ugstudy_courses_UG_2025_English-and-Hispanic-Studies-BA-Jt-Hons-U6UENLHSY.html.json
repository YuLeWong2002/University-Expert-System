            "p": "University Park Campus, Nottingham, UK Are you passionate about language, literature and culture and eager to develop your skills in a language that will take you all over the world? If so, you will love the opportunity to immerse yourself in English language and literature together with Hispanic Studies on this joint honours course. Your time will be divided equally between these two complementary subjects, in which you'll discover parallels and points of comparison throughout the course. In English, you'll take modules covering drama and performance, English language and applied linguistics, literature (from 1500 to the present) and medieval language and literature. We are proud to be ranked top 20 for English in the UK (The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2024 and Complete University Guide 2024). On the Hispanic Studies side, the course combines core language studies and opportunities to explore the cultures and histories of the Spanish and Portuguese-speaking worlds. If you're a beginner in Spanish, an intensive beginners' course will develop your language skills rapidly, ensuring that you reach degree level by your final year. If you begin the course with A level Spanish (or equivalent), you'll study Portuguese as an additional language in year one, with opportunities to continue throughout your studies in order to reach degree level. Alongside your language modules, you'll gain expertise in Spanish and Portuguese literature and culture and the multinational histories associated with both languages. Optional Year 1 Spanish 1 Spanish 1: Beginners Portuguese 1: Beginners Literature in Spanish Drama, Theatre, Performance Studying Literature Studying Language Beginnings of English The above is a sample of the typical modules we offer, but is not intended to be construed or relied on as a definitive list of what might be available in any given year. This content was last updated on Monday 16 December 2024. Due to timetabling availability, there may be restrictions on some module combinations. An average week will have between 12 and 15 hours of classes. As well as scheduled teaching you’ll carry out extensive self-study such as preparation for seminars, assessments and language practice. As a guide 20 credits (a typical module) is approximately 200 hours of work (combined teaching and self-study).

The University of Nottingham is consistently named as one of the most targeted universities by Britain’s leading graduate employers (Ranked in the top ten in The Graduate Market in 2013-2020, High Fliers Research). University Park Campus covers 300 acres, with green spaces, wildlife, period buildings and modern facilities. It is one of the UK's most beautiful and sustainable campuses, winning a national Green Flag award every year since 2003. I’ve found studying two subjects so rewarding. You get to study things from different perspectives which you probably wouldn't be able to do as much as a single honours student. If you want to study more than one subject, you aren't being indecisive and you won't regret it!
