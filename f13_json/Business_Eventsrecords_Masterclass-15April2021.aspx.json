The banknote supply chain is an indispensable and integral part of the modern-day financial system by ensuring an adequate supply of bills in circulation to meet market demands. This is accomplished through the detection of counterfeit bills, the destruction of damaged currency and the issue of new notes to replace those which have been destroyed. Yet, conventional models of banknote supply chain, which are governed centrally by a dominant player in the form of the central banking authority of a country, suffer from problems of operational efficiency. The emergence of blockchain as a distributed technological infrastructure has the potential of disrupting how banknote supply chains are configured. Through an in-depth case study of how the banknote supply chain ecosystem in mainland China has evolved from a centralized governance architecture to one that is founded on peer-to-peer collaborations among banking institutions, this study draws on a path dependency perspective to shed light on the inter-organization mechanisms underpinning the reinforcement and cessation of pre-existing paths pursued by entities within the ecosystem as well as the creation of a new path for the collective body.
