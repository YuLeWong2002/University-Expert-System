            "p": "Researcher working at a computer As part of our mission to challenge the way universities do research and make our research more open and responsive to local communities, Co(l)laboratory has developed the Citizen Scientist Research Placements scheme. These placements aim to give local candidates with promising experience and new ways of thinking opportunities to contribute to positive change for Nottingham and Nottinghamshire communities, through practical research experience. Co(l)laboratory’s placement projects are 6-12 week research projects which aim to explore emerging topics and challenges. Each project is carried out by a local placement candidate and is supported by a team of Nottingham researchers and a partner from a local community-focused organisation. Applications open on Thursday 1 February 2024 and close on Wednesday 6 March 2024. Each placement project is focused on a unique research challenge based on community needs, and is supported by academics from University of Nottingham, Nottingham Trent University, and a local community-focused organisation. Placements are part-time and fully support flexible working to enable candidates to fit the experience around their existing commitments and priorities. All successful candidates are paid a total support payment of £1,156.62 for their time, will receive access to University facilities, and a formal certificate of recognition on completion.
