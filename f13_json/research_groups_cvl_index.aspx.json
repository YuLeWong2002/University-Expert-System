            "p": "The Computer Vision Lab (CVL) is a multidisciplinary group performing basic and applied research in image analysis, computer vision and related areas of machine learning. Today, much of our work focusses on artificial intelligence method development and application, including with technologies such as deep learning, transformers, generative AI, and synthetic data. CVL was established in 2014 and is now the home of many academics, researchers, interns and PhD students. CVL is led by Prof. Andrew French. A key characteristic of the Computer Vision Laboratory is its high level of engagement with other disciplines. We have strong links with colleagues in the Schools of Biosciences, Medicine, Engineering, and with other Computer-Science-based labs such as the Mixed Reality Laboratory. The CVL has collaborated with and received research funding from a variety of partners including ESPRC, BBSRC, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, ARPA-E and the EU, as well as collaborating on industrial grants and consultancy. We have produced several successful spin-out companies in the field of computer vision. There are no results that match your criteria. We are based in Computer Science, Jubilee Campus Map and Directions Email Twitter The University of Nottingham Jubilee Campus Wollaton Road Nottingham, NG8 1BB telephone: +44 (0) 115 8466543 email: andrew.p.french@nottingham.ac.uk"
