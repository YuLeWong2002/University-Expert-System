All Nottingham alumni can continue to benefit from careers advice and support long after graduation. Alumni who register at the University on full time award bearing programmes after spending a period away from the University, are entitled to a scholarship of 10%. Did you know that University of Nottingham alumni have special access to facilities on campus, including our library and sports facilities? Reunions are fantastic fun! It's wonderful to see alumni come back to campus or get together in a new location. Find the answers to your inquiries here.
