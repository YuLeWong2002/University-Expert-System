            "p": "Most University staff are paid a salary which is based on a nationally-agreed scale. The scale is split into six main levels and provides the starting point for a seventh level. The levels are divided into a progression range, from the minimum to the maximum point and an advancement range, for progression above the maximum point to the supermaximum point of the level. For UCU represented staff (staff in the Administrative, Professional and Managerial (APM) job family at Levels 4-6, and all staff in the Research and Teaching (R&T) job family), the University of Nottingham undertakes annual pay negotiations via national collective bargaining. The University of Nottingham will apply the national pay award to staff at Level 7 across APM and R&T job families. For these staff groups, the 2024/25 pay award has been implemented as a two phased pay award. The first phase has been applied from 1 August 2024, with the second phase applying from 1 March 2025. Further details are available via the UoN Intranet. For Unison and Unite represented staff groups (staff in the APM job family at Level 1-3, and all staff in the Technical Services (TS), Childcare Services (CCS) and Operations & Facilities (O&F) job families), the University undertakes local pay negotiations. For these staff groups, the 2024/25 pay award has been implemented as a two phased pay award. The first phase has been applied from 1 May 2024, with the second phase applying from 1 November 2024. Further details are available via Campus News."
