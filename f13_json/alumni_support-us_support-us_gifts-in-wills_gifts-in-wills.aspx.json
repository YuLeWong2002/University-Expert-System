            "p": "Leaving a gift in your Will can help the next generation of students at Nottingham. Imagine an aspiring teacher, doctor or engineer that misses out on a university education at Nottingham because they can’t afford the rising costs of higher education. You have the power to prevent this from happening by remembering Nottingham in your will. Over many decades, gifts in wills have enabled students from low-income backgrounds to study at the University of Nottingham. They have been especially critical during the cost-of-living crisis, providing vital funding for students who might otherwise have had to give up on their dreams. By remembering Nottingham in your will, you could help fund scholarships or give financial hardship assistance to students in urgent need. You could give bright and determined students the opportunity of a university education, enable them to flourish and succeed, and change their lives forever. Leaving even a small percentage - after you have taken care of those closest to you – can make a life-changing difference to the next generation of Nottingham students. Write your will for free If you have the power to help someone like W.H. Revis did, it will change someone’s life like it has for me. It will be with me for the rest of my life. I will always have this experience in my heart. Dolapu Olanubi, recipient of the W.H. Revis legacy. Read more about Dolapu's story.
