The new UoN Graduate Management Trainee scheme has been running since September 2021. The Graduate Management Trainee scheme is designed to provide the foundation for a Professional services career in the Higher Education sector. It is an 18-month scheme, in which trainees typically undertake three placements in different key service areas. Each placement has different responsibilities, including a blend of project work and operational service delivery. This provides the trainees with the opportunity to develop broad skills and experience in HE management and operations.
