The common activities involved in my research include extraction of plant material, chromatographic isolation of compounds, NMR structure elucidation, chemical modification of natural products, and biological evaluation of pure compounds and derivatives. The various analytical/separation tools employed in my research include NMR, high resolution MS, FT-IR, UV-vis, single crystal X-ray crystallography, circular dichroism, and various chromatographic techniques. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8018"
