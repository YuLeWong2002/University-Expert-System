            "p": "As well as hosting a range of activities on campus, we work externally both nationally and internationally to recruit and admit highly capable students to the University. We are committed to maintaining a diverse student population, whether this is through our Widening Participation initiatives or our international student networks. We support applicants through their journey from enquiry to enrolment. We also provide vital advice and support internally to faculties, schools and departments on recruitment and admissions to their courses."
