Meng, a three-time Chinese women’s singles champion, and Yiyi, the national college champion representing south-east Asian women’s teams championships, received awards from Professor Jeremy Gregory, the pro-vice-chancellor for the Faculty of Arts. Both students studied with us last academic year on the Centre for English Language Education's 20-week Presessional English for Academic Purposes course. They have now progressed to studying on the MA Educational Leadership and Management course, whilst continuing to train with the support of the university’s sport department. Congratulations to Meng and Yiyi. Meng Zhou and Professor Jeremy Gregory Yiyi Tao and Professor Jeremy Gregory"
