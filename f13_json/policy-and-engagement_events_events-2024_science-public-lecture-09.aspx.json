            "p": "For any questions about the science public lectures, please contact Hilary Collins or the Institute for Policy and Engagement. The interaction between humans and AI technology has markedly increased in recent years, and is set to become commonplace. Particularly when it comes to AI and Robotics, human factors must play a central role in the development of these technologies. In this lecture, Dr. Deshpande will pitch three areas of research he worked on over his career: telesurgery, teleoperation, and mixed reality training. He will give an insight into the hows, whys, and where tos for each area finally bringing them together through the common theme that runs through his research, keeping the human user at the centre of the development of the technologies. Dr. Deshpande is a member of the Cyber-physical Health and Assistive Robotics Technologies (CHART) group, an interdisciplinary research group, conducting foundational and applied research in intelligent cyber-physical systems and robotics technologies to support personalised health and well-being. This lecture is part of our monthly science public lecture series. These events showcase research from scientists at the University of Nottingham and are free and open to all!
