            "p": "Current research focuses on Metal nanoparticles and nanoclusters and their outstanding size-dependent optical properties that make them the ideal candidates to build optical nanosensors. Careful formulation is often needed to ensure these nanoprobes are stable for sensing application, without compromising their sensitivity. Other work also focuses on synthesizing nanoparticles and nanotubes with potent antimicrobial activities for waste water treatment. Other work in the group focuses on development of new bioassays derived from fluorogenic biotemplated-nanoclusters or colorimetric gold nanoparticles. Current members: This research focuses on investigating and enhancing emerging dosage forms and methods to produce custom made dosage forms in order to tailor the medication to the patient. One of the main avenues of research involves the 3D printing (additive manufacturing) of pharmaceuticals, an area which is expected to play a major role in the future of the pharmaceutical sector. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8018"
