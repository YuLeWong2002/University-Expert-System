            "p": "University Park Campus, Nottingham, UK Art represents power. Art reflects society. Art makes us think and feel. Studying the art history and visual culture helps us see how we got where we are today. And how the future might look. You'll explore visual cultures across periods, media and societies. You'll also look at how art is both written and talked about. All the time you'll be questioning. Why that material? Why that subject? How did people react then? What does it mean now? You'll be free to explore widely or follow a theme such as politics or feminism.
