            "p": "Our courses are career focussed, preparing you for leading roles in patient care, the pharmaceutical industry or research. Before you can study From 15 March 2022, the UK government revoked the requirement for students engaged in patient-facing health or social care settings to be fully vaccinated against Covid-19.
