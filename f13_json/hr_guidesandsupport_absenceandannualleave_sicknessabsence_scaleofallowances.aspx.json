            "p": "Within any span of 12 months, payment of allowances is for the following periods according to length of continuous service. The period during which the allowance is payable in respect of any period of absence is determined by deducting from the employeeâ€™s entitlement any periods of paid absence during the 12 months immediately preceding the first day of absence. The University may, at its discretion, extend the period of allowance in an individual case if there are exceptional circumstances, which justify this. During periods of full pay under the University Sick Pay Scheme, Statutory Sick Pay is paid as part of that payment. When on half pay, Statutory Sick Pay is paid in addition to the half pay allowance. If there is no entitlement to University Sick Pay Allowance then Statutory Sick Pay, if appropriate, is paid in place of any salary payment."
