I really enjoyed studying at the University of Nottingham and it was great to be able to have the option of doing a year in industry. During my third year, I was fortunate enough to spend time at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) as an Industrial Placement student. This was really valuable as it taught me how to apply what I had learned in Nottingham and gave me a taste for what I wanted to do after my degree.
