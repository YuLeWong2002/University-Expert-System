            "p": "Senior Research Fellow, Faculty of Arts I joined UNNC in January 2009 in the Division of English. I previously taught for three years at Lakehead University Orillia Campus and six years at York University, both in Canada. My research expertise is in two broad areas: Systemic Functional Linguistics and Canadian Literature. My work in SFL has been predominantly in language development, language contact, and lexicogrammatical analysis. My work in Canadian Literature has focused on 19th-century texts which reflect a dawning consciousness of national identity. Since my appointment at UNNC, I have begun to focus on language contact between Chinese and English systems, both in the particular campus environment and in a study I have just begun on children's second language development in Chinese. I have also continued my examinations of Canadian English, adding in diachronic analysis to previous work. I am the Programme Chair for the upcoming 2nd ESP in Asia Conference, to be held Nov. 13-17 at UNNC. There is also a strong connection between my research and the classroom. I am currently teaching MA modules on Applied Linguistics, and Literature and Language Teaching, along with a BA module on Language and Context. I am supervising several MA students, including ones working in language acquisition and language teaching practices, along with several PhD students doing exciting work on English classroom practices in China. telephone: +603 8924 8000 fax: +603 8924 8001"
