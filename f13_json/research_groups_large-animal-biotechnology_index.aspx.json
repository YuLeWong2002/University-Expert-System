            "p": "The Centre for Large Animal Biotechnology (CeLAB) carries out research aimed at enhancing the productivity and welfare of farm animals and to develop models of human development and disease. CeLAB utilizes and develops genomic resources and tools to improve the understanding of animal growth and development. Progress in these areas will fulfil the increasing demands for animal protein to feed a growing human world population, and contribute to Global Food Security. Furthermore, because of the physiological similarities between humans and farm animals, research in farm animals contributes to improving our understanding of human development, the causes of genetic disorders, and ageing. CeLAB key research priority areas are addressed in the following 4 research themes: CeLAB Technologies CeLAB Research Themes CeLAB Core Technologies Leaders CeLAB Research Themes Leaders The University of Nottingham Sutton Bonington Campus Loughborough, LE12 5RD telephone: +44 (0) 115 951 6302 email: Lorraine.sabin@Nottingham.ac.uk"
