            "p": "The Group has close ties to Network Rail, and Lloyd's Register Foundation. The efficient performance of our critical infrastructure and its complex systems is vital to modern society, particularly in the transport, energy production and distribution, utilities and communications sectors. This multi-disciplinary group is dedicated to conducting research into developing modelling techniques to predict ways of improving the design, maintenance, and operation of engineering systems in order to reduce the frequency and consequences of failure. We also focus on improving the resilience of engineering systems to a broad range of disruptive events, from hazardous system failures, to natural and manmade disasters, ensuring adequate defences against their consequences, management of the disruptive event, and the rapid restoration of system functionality.
