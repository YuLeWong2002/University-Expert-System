            "p": "\"Our focus is research and training into the development of children, the influence of families on children and mental health, the causes of criminal behaviour and the prevention of crime.\" --Professor Kevin Browne, Director of CFFP We take a public health approach to investigating the causes and consequences of family violence, child maltreatment and serious crime. Our director of centre and programme directors are all HCPC-registered practitioner psychologists as well as experienced academic researchers. Our focus is on high quality research, which has a real impact on policy and practice. As practitioners and academic psychologists, we are dedicated to the development of evidence-based practice to prevent violence, abuse and neglect in individuals, families and communities. Our staff and students conduct research into the causes and consequences of offending behaviours, as well as evaluating risk assessments and interventions. We have a particular focus on early trauma and adverse experiences in childhood in order to understand the development of mental health problems, personality disorder traits and criminal behaviours. This informs health and social care for children, families and communities. We are also conscious that forensic psychology involves individuals who are often stigmatised. Through both quantitative and qualitative methods, we aim to understand and share the experiences of victims, offenders, service users and staff in forensic settings. We teach theory, practice and research to postgraduate students and trainees. Browne, K.D., Craig, L., Beech, A. & Chou, S. Eds. (2017). Assessments in Forensic Practice: A Handbook.
