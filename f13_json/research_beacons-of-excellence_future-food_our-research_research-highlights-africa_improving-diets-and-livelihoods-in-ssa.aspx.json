            "p": "The Future Food Beacon has a number of projects in various countries across the continent of Africa, including Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, Senegal, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The scale of the work ranges from the widescreen ambitions of Geonutrition and its follow up projects across sub-Saharan Africa, all the way to detoxifying the humble grass pea. We have grouped these projects together in this Research Highlight to demonstrate the breadth and depth of Future Food Beacon projects in Africa. How can we best influence the nutritional value of crops? Understanding soil for better food security Can we develop tools to visualise the scale and distribution of micronutrient deficiencies? Our researchers are exploring historical soil maps Our researchers are working to improve population health in Zimbabwe Researchers are creating data platforms to help children's outcomes We're honing in on an underused food source Identifying new varieties of pearl millet better adapted to the future Removing a deadly twist from a key insurance crop for the poorest of the poor We are creating new opportunities for farmers to sell their crops"
