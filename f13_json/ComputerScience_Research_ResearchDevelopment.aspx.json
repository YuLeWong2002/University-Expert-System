            "p": "Overview The main focus of research in the School of Computer Science at the University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) lies in the development of various intelligent systems and computational techniques with applications to a wide range of real-world problems. The schoolâ€™s multi-disciplinary research includes areas in image processing and computer vision, AI and applications, human-computer interaction and ubiquitous computing, software engineering, E-Learning, simulation and modelling, and computational intelligence. The research conducted within the school is generally focused on developing advanced computer science and artificial intelligence technologies, which in turn is linked to several university wide priority areas, such as Precision Imaging and Smart Products, which are Beacons of Excellence at the UK Campus. Our research also creates collaborative links to other local and international research organizations, universities, government agencies and industries that can benefit from intelligent computing. The main research themes currently being pursued within the school include: Human Computer Interaction and Ubiquitous Computing Software Engineering and E-Learning Research at the UK Campus of the School was ranked in the top 10 per cent of UK Institutions in the 2014 Research Excellence Framework. The research activity in the school was considered of international quality, with 80 per cent of it rated as world class/internationally leading. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8018"
