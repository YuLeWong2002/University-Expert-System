            "p": "We aim to provide a positive working environment to help you get the most out of working at the University. Continual investment in our surroundings ensures that the working experience at the University is the best it can be. From provisions for childcare and health, restaurants and cafes to concerts and drama, working life at the University should be as enjoyable as possible. From childcare to banks, restaurants to computer facilities - your environment and the facilities we provide are an important part of working life at the University. The Lakeside Arts Centre plays a key role in Nottingham's cultural life, with it's fully accessible, purpose-built venues - including a newly opened museum. We are committed to becoming a leading green university, with environmental sustainability as one of nine guiding principles in our Strategic Plan. We offer a range of transport options to benefit both you and the environment, through investment in cycling and inter-campus hopper bus services."
