            "p": "Our clinical epidemiology research, which has impacted substantially on healthcare policy, spans multiple disease areas including:- Particular methodological strengths are development and use of large e-health databases, conduct of cohort studies in developing countries, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Across many different clinical areas there are gaps in our knowledge of the true burden of disease, those most at risk of developing disease, short and long-term consequences of illness and the effectiveness and safety of current therapies. Clinical epidemiology is a broad discipline which contributes much needed evidence to try and fill some of these gaps and is used by practising clinicians and by health policy makers.
