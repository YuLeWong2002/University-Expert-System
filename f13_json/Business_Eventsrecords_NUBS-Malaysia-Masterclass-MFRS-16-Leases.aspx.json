Please RSVP before 10 June 2019 with Dr Angelina Yee (Director, Executive Education) at Angelina.Yee@nottingham.edu.my MFRS 16 Leases deals with accounting for lease contracts. Lease contracts and the assets, liabilities, income and expenses arising from these contracts could be large in size and significant to a companyâ€™s financial performance and position. This new accounting standard is expected to significantly change the way firms account for leases. More importantly, it may affect debt covenants of firms with banks and creditors. This masterclass provides a review of the potential challenges and significant impacts of the transition to and implementation of the Malaysian Accounting Standards Board's new accounting standard for leases, MFRS 16, which took effect from 1 January 2019.
