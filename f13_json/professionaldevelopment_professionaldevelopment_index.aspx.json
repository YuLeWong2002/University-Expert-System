            "p": "Continuing Professional Development (CPD) is a combination of approaches, ideas and techniques that will help you manage your own learning and growth. Wherever you are in your career now and whatever you would like to achieve in the future, the process will help you identify and acquire the skills and experience you need to realise your goals. CPD isn’t a fixed process and it’s not just about going on training courses or evidence collecting. It is about gaining useful experiences and reflecting on how what you have learnt is beneficial. The focus of CPD is firmly on results - the benefits that professional development can bring you in the real world. One of the most common misconceptions about keeping a CPD record is that it takes a lot of time on top of your normal workload to achieve results. Actually CPD is more of an attitude than a time-consuming process; often the most effective personal development is about harnessing the value of what you have learned from your daily activities. Ownership of CPD rests with the individual and, hence, each person’s plan and record is completely personal to them. Planning and recording your CPD is essentially an investment that you make in yourself: The University of Nottingham recognises that its staff are a key resource and is dedicated to attracting and retaining the best possible staff. Supporting each individual’s CPD process is fundamental to achieving this aim.
