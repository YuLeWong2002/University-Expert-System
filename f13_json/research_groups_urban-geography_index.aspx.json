Our work examines the social and physical processes which shape urban culture and environments, and uses this understanding to address key global challenges. Our research on air pollution, water quality and environmental change is working to make our cities safer, healthier and more sustainable. Our focus on urban economies and labour markets is offering new insights into how the global economy works; as well as exploring the challenges and opportunities that urbanisation poses in the developing world. Our study of urban planning, culture and history addresses key questions of identity and politics, as well as exploring how cities can be spaces for furthering social and environmental justice.
