            "p": "We manage an interdisciplinary studentship scheme that saw its first intake of students in September 2019. Our students are undertaking projects in a wide variety of disciplines covering the physics and computations aspects of imaging biomarkers and their application in mental and physical health, and biomedicine. Sarah is bridging pharmaceutical sciences and imaging to provide new insights into the colonic environment. combining brain imaging techniques with advanced autonomic measures to explore the role of the locus coeruleus-noradrenaline brain system in ADHD. Using multimodal imaging and brain stimulation to study the role of neurophysiological inhibition on somatomotor mapping in TS. Georgia is developing and embedding anatomical models into Deep Learning algorithms for brain MRI analysis. Jose is focused on the cross-modal integration of imaging techniques for modelling the brain connectome. Developing and implementing the deuterium metabolic imaging (DMI) method at ultra-high field to brain cancer in Nothingham. Cameron is applying theranostics to the treatment of vascular disease, via MRI imaging of selectins expressed during inflamation. David is developing contrast agents to image inflammation via MRI to inform the design of medical implanting devices. Mairi is combining brain imaging and brain stimulation to deliver novel therapies for brain health conditions. Developing safer MRI techniques for lung imaging longitidunal studies, specifically hyperpolarized gas MRI, with a focus on xenon and krypton. Jian Hu is identifying brain perfusion signatures to detect and monitor neurological disease progression from early stages."
