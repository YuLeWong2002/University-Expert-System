            "p": "A large proportion of our civil engineering students go on to work as graduate civil or structural engineers, and many work towards chartership with the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) or other professional bodies as they progress through their careers. Equally, some students choose to use the skills they have gained throughout their degree to move into graduate roles outside of civil engineering, or to develop new skills and specialisms through further study. Talk to an adviser Check out our events Search for vacancies or internships In addition to your subject knowledge the degree equips you with key employability skills, which are relevant to all sectors: A degree in civil engineering will provide you with the education base to work towards Chartered or Incorporated Engineer status through the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) or the Institution of Structural Engineers (IStructE), both of whom accredit University of Nottingham civil engineering degrees. This can be a good way of demonstrating and accrediting your professional competence as an engineer once you start in the workplace. MEng graduates will have the education base required for Chartership, while BEng graduates will have the educational base for Incorporated Engineer status. However it is also possible for a BEng graduate to achieve Chartered status through further learning in the workplace. Institution of Civil Engineers Institution of Structural Engineers TARGETjobs - becoming a chartered or incorporated engineer Graduates from Nottingham who have gone on to work as graduate civil or structural engineers over the last few years have worked for a range of employers from large multi-national companies to small local employers. High quality graduate roles are available in companies of all sizes and types, so it’s important to think about which type of organisation and opportunity you feel you would be best suited to. Here are some of the types of employers that civil engineering students from Nottingham have gone on to work for over the last few years: Looking for graduate vacancies - go to our civil engineering careers page Other engineering roles such as environmental engineering, construction management, surveying engineering can either be progressed into directly with civil engineering degree or following from a more specialised MSc. Not all engineering graduates become engineers. Many of our graduates find alternative opportunities where they are able to use their transferable skills including: Some students will progress into further study at postgraduate level in both engineering and non-engineering related areas. Examples of recent further study destinations of civil engineering students include: Postgraduate study can be a way to develop a further specialism in a particular area of interest, either through carrying out research or undertaking specialist taught modules. It can also be a way to gain skills and qualifications in areas outside engineering in order to progress into alternative careers. For students doing a BEng qualification, undertaking an accredited MSc will give you the level of qualification necessary to progress on to become a chartered engineer and to meet the entry requirements of some graduate engineering employers who ask for a masters level qualification. For students doing an MEng degree, undertaking an MSc won’t give you a higher level qualification, but it can be a way of specialising in a particular area. Explore your further study options - finding courses, funding and making applications Regardless of whether you are a first year or final year, developing skills outside your degree will enhance your CV and allow you to provide evidence of these in applications and at interviews.
