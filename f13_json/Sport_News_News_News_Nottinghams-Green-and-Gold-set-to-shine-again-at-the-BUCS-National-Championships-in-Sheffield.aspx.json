As the championships draw closer, we reflect on the Green and Gold’s past accomplishments and look to the 2024 edition with optimism. We are always thrilled to see Nottingham's student-athletes compete at BUCS Nationals with unwavering pride and determination, adding to our legacy at the event. The return of Fencing and Karate to the Championships adds further excitement to Nottingham's participation. Having had separate championships last year, our athletes from these disciplines are ready to make a statement on the national stage alongside their peers once again. Nottingham has a proud history of success in various disciplines and is all set to make its mark once again on the BUCS national stage. Among the highlights are the karate team's quest to defend their National Championship title. With an exceptional lineup of athletes, the side are aiming to emerge victorious and retain in this discipline. Para swimmer Owen Say, who won gold in short-course swimming at Spines Forge earlier this year, is preparing to compete at the Long Course Championships at Ponds Forge. Say won gold and two silver medals at the same championships last year, and his commitment to adding to his tally exemplifies Nottingham's dedication to excellence. We also eagerly anticipate Emma Futcher's return to climbing at the Climbing Works Sheffield after her historic achievement in winning Nottingham's first-ever climbing medal in 2023. Kirby Ngan's recent triumph at the Senior National Badminton Championships highlights her status as the reigning and defending BUCS Champion in badminton. Last year saw Ngan triumph and bring home a Gold in Women's Singles, and a Silver with Sian Kelly in Women's Doubles. As Ngan aims to extend her legacy at this year's BUCS National Championships, we will be cheering from the stands. As all of our Green and Gold student-athletes attend Nationals, they carry with them the pride of Nottingham and the determination to continue our fantastic year of achievements in BUCS competition so far.
