            "p": "Assistant Professor, My primary research interests are in the fields of software engineering, software quality, software measurements, cloud computing and Internet of Thing. My research is driven by a strong desire to bridge the digital divide and make computing useful. My research specifically focuses on: Computer science, as a field, has largely focused on problems relevant to the developed world. The Internet and the World Wide Web have remained largely urban phenomena. Bridging this digital divide requires us to address several important and challenging computer science research problems whose solutions will ultimately have significant impact on global development. Conventional computing solutions are often inappropriate in these emerging contexts due to various contextual factors including lack of infrastructure, limited purchasing power, poor connectivity, limited power, language and literacy issues, and lack of local expertise for managing systems. These unique infrastructure, cost, power and connectivity constraints create several new research challenges which often require a fundamental rethinking in the way we design computing solutions. Teaching Modules Expand into interdisciplinary fields in Computer Science such as Internet of Things, Website, Neural Network, HCI, and others.
