The Support Plan can make staff in your academic school aware of any issues which may arise, and facilitate you using any assistive technology that may help you during your studies. This may include reasonable adjustments for presentations, group work, oral exams, placements or any other element of your course where speaking is required. Other support that we can offer is detailed below and you can contact us by emailing Disability Support Services where you will be allocated a Disability Adviser to discuss your support with you. Support in your academic school - We can liaise with your school's Disability Liaison Officer to help you with any questions you may have related to your course. Funding – We can advise how to apply for a Disabled Students’ Allowance (DSA) which may fund specialist software to support you in your studies.
