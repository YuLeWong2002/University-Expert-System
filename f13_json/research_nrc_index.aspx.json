            "p": "The National Rehabilitation Centre (NRC) Programme at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, has been created to transform outcomes for people who have suffered potentially life-changing injury, trauma or illness. Central to the NRC Programme is the creation of the NRC rehabilitation facility which forms part of the Government’s ‘New Hospital Programme’. The NRC building, which will be run and staffed by Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, is currently under construction on the Stanford Hall Rehabilitation Estate between Nottingham and Loughborough and is located close to the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC). The 70-bed rehabilitation facility will bring together research, innovation, education and training, alongside clinical practice to drive excellence in rehabilitation and opens for patients in 2025. The NRC network of staff, healthcare practitioners and connected researchers will be uniquely placed to pioneer international research into clinical rehabilitation, rehabilitation sciences and technologies and products all to improve, patient care and recovery. The University of Nottingham and Loughborough University are leading on Research and Innovation at the NRC through the delivery of the NRC Academic Network bringing together a ‘hub and spoke’ network of more than 20 universities across the country so that hundreds of educators and researchers can work with and learn from each other, co-ordinating the overall approach to rehabilitation research. If you have a query about the University of Nottingham and its clinical and academic partnership with the National Rehabilitation Centre, please email us at nrc@nottingham.ac.uk."
