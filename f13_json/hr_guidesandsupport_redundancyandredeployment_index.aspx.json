            "p": "This area is designed to support staff through the very difficult process of redundancy and redeployment. It is important to note that each redundancy situation will be unique and it is, therefore, important to involve your HR Business Partner at the earliest opportunity. However, before doing so you are advised to read the relevant document from the policies and procedures available on the HR Workspace pages via the links below. If you cannot access the HR Workspace pages, please contact the HR Employment Services team, email: hr@nottingham.ac.uk."
