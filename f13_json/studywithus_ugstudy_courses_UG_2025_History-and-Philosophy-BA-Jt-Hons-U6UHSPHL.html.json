This degree lets you explore human history and thought from its most ancient periods to the present day. Across each subject, you can explore the moral, social, political, religious, and scientific developments that have made human life possible, and which continue to challenge humanity today. Our geographic scope is wide and diverse, from Britain and Europe to Asia, North America and Africa. You will gain the skills, understanding, and knowledge to describe and make sense of these ideas and events, and to argue for your own interpretations of them. These are the transferrable skills needed for a wide range of exciting careers.

This content was last updated on Wednesday 4 September 2024. Due to timetabling availability, there may be restrictions on some module combinations. You’ll have at least the following hours of timetabled contact a week through lectures, seminars and workshops, tutorials and supervisions. Your tutors will also be available outside these times to discuss issues and develop your understanding. We reduce your contact hours as you work your way through the course. As you progress, we expect you to assume greater responsibility for your studies and work more independently. Your tutors will all be qualified academics, many of whom are internationally recognised in their fields. Outside of your contact hours, the rest of the time is yours to carry out independent work and self-directed study. This may mean time spent in the library, doing preparation work for seminars, reading books and journal articles from the reading list, and researching or writing your assignments. This may also involve working with other students on group tasks. As a guide, 20 credits (a typical module) is approximately 200 hours of work (combined teaching and self-directed study).
