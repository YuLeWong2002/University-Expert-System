            "p": "Research at gene to population levels to promote the health and welfare of animals and their owners or producers. Extensive expertise in epidemiology, mathematical modelling, bioinformatics, behaviour and sociological research methods. The theme houses four centres of excellence: • Application of bioinformatics to study biological problems, comparative genomic, evolution and houses Advanced Data Analysis Centre (ADAC). • Dairy herd health and Sheep flock health groups who research areas affecting health and welfare of dairy cows and sheep. These groups work closely with dairy and sheep industry to enhance knowledge transfer. • Centre of Evidence Based Veterinary Medicine (CEVM), which aims to increase the amount and availability of clinically relevant research to veterinarians to enable them to incorporate evidence into decision-making. • Areas of animals and society, making science public and understanding barriers and drivers of decision making by different stakeholders. • Using physiological and and behavioural approaches to assess and improve the welfare of UK zoo elephants, welfare and health assessment of dogs and dynamics of the dog-owner relationship. • Development of mathematical models to simulate the spread of livestock and zoonotic diseases. There were 3 impact cases submitted in REF 2013 from the theme. These included prevention of dry period infections in dairy cows, Implementing the British Dairy Herd National Mastitis Control Scheme-The “DairyCo Mastitis Control Plan” and Advancing analgesic use in cattle. There are no results that match your criteria.
