            "p": "Castle Meadow Campus Design Team Bond Bryan Architects Completion Autumn 2024 One of the seven buildings located in Nottingham city centre, Building D, formerly known as Howard House, forms part of the University of Nottingham’s Castle Meadow Campus. The proposed refurbishment works to Building D comprise the creation of a new dedicated entrance and full refurbishment throughout the existing three-storey building, to facilitate the operational needs of its new intended use as office accommodation for long-term campus based partners. Full refurbishment of the existing building for use as rentable office facilities for business partners. Typical user group sizes will range from half of a floor to a full-floor per tenant. The building 'shell and core' works will be done by the university's appointed building contractors; all fit-out works by the tenants. Each floor shall include WC facilities, with the remainder of the space being fitted-out by the Tenant(s) (i.e. kitchenettes, meeting rooms, etc). This building is flexible and adaptable – with the ability to change internal office layouts quite frequently, to respond to differing user’s needs. A sensitive response has been considered to the existing building, which takes into account the existing ventilation strategy and building fabric. Careful consideration has been given to the existing building fabric, both in response to the original design ethos and the physical condition of the original building materials, some 30 years after completion. One key design driver is the existing heating and ventilation strategy, which currently utilises the raised access floors as air plenums at each floor level and ventilation at roof level to naturally ventilate the building. These existing systems are to be utilised where possible and practical."
