            "p": "All the results you see in NUsearch are for resources that we have online access to, plus everything we hold in our libraries. Clicking on Expand beyond library collections increases the number of hits from your search and introduces to your results list resources that may be highly relevant and useful, but which we don’t have online access to. Don’t think of this as a dead end, though. You can click on the Check availability link to see ways for you to get hold of the article, book chapter or other resource that you need. If we don’t have the print version at the University of Nottingham, you can check for an Open Access version, or apply for an Interlibrary Loan. Please see our contact page for telephone and email contact points."
