Fees and Payments Student enquiry centre The timeline below should help you to understand how the financial elements involved while studying at the University fit into the academic year (August - July). Please note, students that do not register or start study in September may be subject to different due/funding dates. It’s important to remember that everyone who attends university is an adult. That means we can’t share information about them without their consent, even if you are paying fees on their behalf. Students can view their charges and make payments online via their NottinghamHub account at any time, easy to follow guides can help with this. There are other ways to pay, and students can access FAQ’s and raise queries via student enquiry centre. The FAQ’s on this page can help if you want to know who to contact in an emergency or if your loved one needs additional support."
