            "p": "In addition to our ongoing 'Voices' series held in the Kuala Lumpur CBD, we also run a number of public seminars located on our campus in Semenyih. Entitled 'Voices from the Hills' (a play on Broga Hill, a popular hiking spot abutting the campus, and the somewhat far-flung nature of the campus!), these lectures and forums come from a range of visiting speakers from Malaysia, the ASEAN region, and further afield. Some are friends of staff working in the CSCC, others are visitors from the Nottingham UK campus, and yet others have been invited or requested by the CSCC student community. if you have any queries. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8693 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8020"
