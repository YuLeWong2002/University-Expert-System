            "p": "Senior Research Finance Manager, Financial & Business Services I have worked in R&I for nearly 19 years. During this time I have initiated the set up of the EU team and evolved the team as the portfolio and complexity of EU funded projects has grown. The EU team is a team of 7 individuals who collectively have a huge amount of experience in supporting applications, negotiations and administration of EU funded research projects. My role is to lead and coordinate the activities of the team to ensure that not only do we fully comply with the rules and regulations of the funding but that we also maximize the Universities income and margin on EU projects.
