            "p": "This page contains the supplementary regulations for the Degree of Master of Research (MRes) in Geography from September 2019, including admissions, examination and award of degree information. Its content is relevant to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses. The regulations for the MRes portfolio in Geography are those which govern the University of Nottingham MRes available here: Regulations for the Degree of Master of Research (MRes) from September 2019 Except where the following sections modify or supplement them 1. Requirements for admission to a research degree are set out in the University of Nottingham’s Quality Manual in the section entitled Admissions. For more information, please consult the following: Admissions 3. Students are required to study modules worth 180 credits, of which a maximum of 60 credits must be obtained from taught modules at Level 4 or from the Research Training Programme run by the Researcher Academy (formerly the Graduate School) or other units offering generic training within the University, or from within any other relevant training courses run within Schools. The remaining 120-180 credits must be obtained from a thesis module at Level 4. Any taught modules and research training taken must be clearly cognate with the student’s research topic. Supervision while undertaking the thesis module will be as set out in the module specification and in line with the requirements for supervision contained in the regulations for research degrees. 4. The University’s Quality and Standards Committee has approved a variation in the number of taught credits required for this programme, as permitted under Regulation 4. of the University’s Regulations for the degree of Master of Research (MRes). Includes: module specifications; submitting thesis before end of registered study; viva voce examinations 6. The assessment of all modules is as set out in the specifications for those modules. In regard to the thesis module, the maximum word length of the thesis is adjusted in accordance with the number of taught credits undertaken: such that a thesis module 120 credits should not exceed 25,000 words, a thesis of 140 credits should not exceed 30,000 words, a thesis of 160 credits should not exceed 35,000 words and a thesis of 180 credits should not exceed 40,000 words. The maximum word limit is inclusive of appendices, footnotes, tables but not the bibliography. The Thesis should embody the result of the candidate’s advanced study and research. 7. Students are required to submit their thesis prior to the end of the period of registered study. A electronic version, saved as a searchable PDF, should be submitted to the relevant Registry and Academic Affairs PGR team or equivalent, who will forward the thesis to the Examiners. The thesis should not, whether in the same or a different form, have been submitted to this or any other University for the award of any degree. 8. The thesis must be the result of the student’s own work. The requirement does not preclude a student obtaining limited assistance with proof-reading and with the routine collection and/or processing of data under guidelines and instructions clearly devised by the student. When such help is obtained it should be with the prior approval of the supervisor who must be satisfied that the spirit of the 'own work' requirement is not breached. 9. The thesis is examined by both an External Examiner and an Internal Examiner appointed under the regulations governing the assessment of research degrees, who should provide independent reports on the thesis, indicating whether the thesis module has been passed; and also whether a viva voce examination is necessary. Where a viva voce examination is required by the examiners, this should be conducted in line with the relevant regulations for MPhil degrees. For more information about the Viva voce examinations, please consult the following: Viva voce examinations Includes: award of degree; where a student obtains a fail mark or failed thesis or training credits; nottingham etheses service 10. The degree is awarded where all taught modules and training credits and the thesis module have been passed. The pass mark for all taught modules is 50%, but marks of 40%-49% can be compensated in up to 20 credits if the overall average for the taught modules taken is 50% or over. Training credits will be assessed on a pass/fail basis. 11. Where a student obtains a fail mark in a taught module, or fails the thesis module or training credits, the student has one further opportunity to pass those modules. All reassessments must be completed within one year of the end of the student's period of registered study. 12. The qualification awarded to the student will include the subject of study undertaken as notified to the student at the time of admission. 13. Successful candidates will be eligible to graduate once their thesis has been uploaded to the University’s etheses service and approved by the Internal Examiner or, in cases where there are two external examiners, the lead External Examiner.
