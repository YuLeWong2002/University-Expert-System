            "p": "Café Ideas is an event organised by ICEMiC. It is a platform for the PGR students, postdoc researchers and staff members of the School of Sociology and Social Policy to share their own academic ideas about a future publication or project and receive friendly comments from peers. Café Ideas is an event similar to café philosophique and café scientifique, but in an academic environment and with more restrictions in terms of time for each presentation. The goal is to collectively brainstorm about an emerging idea that will turn into academic research of a colleague. If you’re interested in presenting your ideas in the next Café, please email the title of your research to ICEMiC Director: Dr Morteza Hashemi at morteza.hashemi@nottingham.ac.uk School of Sociology and Social Policy Law and Social Sciences building University of Nottingham University Park Nottingham, NG7 2RD +44 (0)115 951 5393"
