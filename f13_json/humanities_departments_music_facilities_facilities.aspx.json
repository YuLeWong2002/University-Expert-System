All bookings for the Djanogly Recital Hall and the Rehearsal Hall should be made to music-bookings@nottingham.ac.uk. Practice rooms can be booked online using the process below. Enquiries about other rooms should be directed to music-bookings@nottingham.ac.uk. The 200-seat hall hosts professional concerts by outstanding international musicians, and student lunchtime concert series, rehearsals and recital examinations. It was acoustically designed by David Kenton Jones, a world leader in concert-hall acoustics. It was listed in 2012 as one of the UKâ€™s top 10 venues for chamber music by Classical Music Magazine, and is used by the Department of Music and also by Nottingham Lakeside Arts. First year recital pianists can book one hour per week on the Steinway piano in the Djanogly Recital Hall in the summer term only. Second and third year recital pianists can book two hours per week on the Steinway piano and are particularly advised to book rehearsals in the Recital Hall in advance. Please note that a series of professional concerts take place in the Recital Hall on most Thursdays and Saturdays and that there are regular ensemble rehearsals on most evenings during term time.

It also stores our extensive collection of instruments. Contains state-of-the-art sound insulation and an adjacent live room. This arrangement means students: Students can explore everything from synthesis to recording, to syncing audio in visuals in an extremely flexible and creative way. It is not open for external hire as studio time is strictly reserved for Music Technology students who require the facility in order to complete their coursework portfolios.
