            "p": "This page provides an introduction to the scope of student support, development and personal tutoring for all undergraduate and postgraduate students. Its content is relevant to staff and students across all of the UK, China and Malaysia campuses. The aim of the student support, development and personal tutoring programme at Nottingham is to provide appropriate personalised developmental support and encouragement for the student to reach their academic potential, maximum personal and professional development and employability skills acquisition throughout their time at Nottingham. All members of University staff have an important role to play in maximising the experience of every student. The remaining pages within this category of the Quality Manual outline the particular responsibilities in this area placed on schools, personal tutors, Senior Tutors and central support services. However, it is important to appreciate that effective levels of student support and development require high levels of integration and information exchange across the wide variety of support and development services of the University. It is important that all parties recognise that student development is about more than helping those students with particular academic or personal difficulties. Whilst such students clearly need our assistance, the best support and development provision will engage with every student to help them to maximise their potential whilst studying at the University of Nottingham.
