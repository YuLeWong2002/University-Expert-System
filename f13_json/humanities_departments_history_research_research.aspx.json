            "p": "The Department of History has more than 30 full-time members of academic staff, all of whom are active researchers and whose research closely informs their teaching. In REF 2021, we placed 23rd out of 81 departments nationally for research activity, with more than 80% of outputs and 100% of both Impact and Environment rated as either 'World Leading' or 'Internationally Excellent'. We were placed 15th for our excellence in research impact. Staff expertise ranges from the medieval period down almost to the present day, and from local history to global developments. Our staff investigate major issues in society, politics, race, gender relations and international affairs, as well as the study of history itself; and their work often involves links to other schools/departments and to institutions beyond the university.
