It draws upon the resources of the University, linking with academic and business support staff within other Schools and units across. The BPU acts as a focal point for enquiries from companies and external organisations, helping to match their needs with the capabilities of the School. The BPU is responsible for identifying research with commercial potential, maintaining the patent portfolio and promoting collaborations with industrial/commercial partners to help bring these technologies to commercial reality. The BPU provides advice, guidance, training and support for staff and students in key aspects of Business Practice, Innovation Management and Intellectual Property.
