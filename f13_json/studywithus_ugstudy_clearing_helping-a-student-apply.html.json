Applying through Clearing can be a stressful, confusing or upsetting experience for many students, and may mean rethinking their study plans. Support and guidance from their family or education professionals can help them get through the process and make a bright start to their university life. Clearing applications should usually be made by the students themselves rather than parents, agents or other persons. Under UCAS policies and data protection rules, we can only discuss your child's or student's application if you are a nominated contact in their UCAS application. See our privacy policy.
