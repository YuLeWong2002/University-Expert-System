            "p": "Doctoral training programmes offer high-quality funded PhD opportunities in centres of excellence, with integrated research training and development. The course structure is sufficiently flexible for students to acquire a range of personal and professional skills which can be tailored to suit their career aspirations. Securing an opportunity at a doctoral training programme is an excellent way to set yourself apart, and work at the cutting-edge of research. The University has won substantial awards from the UK Research Councils as well as other funding bodies to support the training and work of the next generation of researchers through our portfolio of doctoral training programmes."
