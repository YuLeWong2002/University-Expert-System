Supported by the Haydn Green Foundation, HGI is at the forefront of creating a culture of entrepreneurship and innovation at the university. If you are interested in learning how to turn your business ideas into reality, then our entrepreneurship education combines theory and practice - our courses are taught by both academics and business experts, and we are keen to equip our students with \"real-world\" experiences. Our world-leading research covers entrepreneurship education, innovation, and inclusive and sustainable entrepreneurship. Our researchers are investigating a wide-range of topics, such as barriers to women becoming entrepreneurs, empowering farmers in rural China and using social media as an entrepreneurial tool. We also provide lots of opportunities for you to develop your entrepreneurial aspirations further by taking part in competitions such as the Young Entrepreneurs Scheme and the Ingenuity Programme. In the Entrepreneurship and Innovation Department, we equip our students to address real world challenges posed by business and society, in an effective, profitable and sustainable way.
