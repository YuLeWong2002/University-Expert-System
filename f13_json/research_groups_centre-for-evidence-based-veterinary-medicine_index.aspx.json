            "p": "‘Evidence-based Veterinary Medicine' is the use of best relevant evidence in conjunction with clinical expertise to make the best possible decision about a veterinary patient. The circumstances of each patient, and the circumstances and values of the owner/carer must also be considered when making an evidence-based decision’ The aim of the Centre for Evidence-based Veterinary Medicine is to increase the awareness and use of evidence-based principles in the veterinary profession. We are a multidisciplinary research team of veterinary and non-veterinary researchers and our work is targeted at increasing the amount and availability of clinically relevant research to veterinarians to enable them to incorporate evidence into decision-making.
