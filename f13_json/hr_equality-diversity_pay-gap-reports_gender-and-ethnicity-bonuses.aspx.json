            "p": "Difference 1.6% 8.1% The Mean bonus pay gap between Men and Women remains largely the same as in 2022 (65.6%) and has continued to decrease over time and is now the lowest recorded (65.4%). In 2017, the Mean bonus pay gap recorded was 77.5% which equates to a total decrease over time of 12.1%. The Median bonus pay gap between Men and Women has increased by 26.1% since the previous reporting period. In 2023, fewer low value bonuses were awarded to staff, however, the overall the distribution of bonus values for Women were lower in comparison to Men. Furthermore, the bonus pay gap continues to be influenced by Clinical Excellence Awards which are higher in value and awarded to Clinical Academic staff, who are mostly Male. The Mean bonus pay gap between White and Racially Minoritised employees has decreased over time. In 2020, the Mean bonus pay gap recorded was -111.80% which has since reduced to -52.80% in 2023 (59.0% difference). This data shows that out of all employees who received a bonus payment, the amount of bonus pay received (on average) has continued to be higher for employees who are Racially Minoritised in comparison to White employees. This year we began reporting on Disability Pay Gap data for the first time and therefore this is the first and only reporting period available for review. However, we recognise that the Mean disability bonus pay gap is low at 22.7% and the Median bonus pay gap is -11.3% which is in the favour of employees who have declared one or more form of disability."
