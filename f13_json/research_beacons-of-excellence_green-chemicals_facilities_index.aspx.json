            "p": "We are investing in state-of-the-art equipment, and significant physical and digital infrastructure to deliver our ambitious goals. The GSK Carbon Neutral Laboratory for Sustainable Chemistry is located on the Universityâ€™s award-winning innovation park, the new carbon neutral laboratory provides unrivalled facilities for chemistry, and is home to some of the key research undertaken by our Beacon. It occupies 4,500 square metres over two floors, and is built entirely from natural materials. The energy required to run the facility is met by renewable sources such as solar power and sustainable biomass. Excess energy created by the building provides enough carbon credits over 25 years to pay back the carbon used in its construction. We are opening state-of-the-art Sustainable Processing Laboratories later this year. These facilities will be highly flexible, incorporating significant future proofing as a research hotel environment. This world-leading facility will contribute synergistically to the BioPilotsUK Biorefining Centres, setting Nottingham apart as a centre of excellence in sustainable processing. Strong collaborative links will be enabled with institutions such as:"
