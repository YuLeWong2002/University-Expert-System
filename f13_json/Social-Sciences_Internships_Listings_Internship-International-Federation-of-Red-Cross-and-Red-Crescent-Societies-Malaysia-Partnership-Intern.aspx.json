The war had shown a need for close cooperation between Red Cross Societies, which, through their humanitarian activities on behalf of prisoners of war and combatants, had attracted millions of volunteers and built a large body of expertise. A devastated Europe could not afford to lose such a resource. Position Background The IFRC Asia Pacific regional office has developed relations with a number of major international and regional organisations active in the humanitarian field. The internship is established to support the IFRC Partnerships and Resource Development team to establish and develop sustainable partnerships with relevant donors, with particular focus on resource management, accountability and relationship development for humanitarian and development programmes. The duration of the internship will be three (3) to six (6)-months. Note: This internship is aimed at School of Politics, History and International Relations (PHIR) third year and PGT students.
