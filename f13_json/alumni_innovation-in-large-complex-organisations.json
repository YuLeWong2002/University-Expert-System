            "p": "Most organisations find innovation difficult, particularly spreading new ideas and new ways of working beyond their original home. This is particularly difficult in healthcare, where, despite a strong track record in original (and sometimes life-saving) innovation, it can take up to 17 years for a new treatment or technology to become widespread. Researchers at the Centre for Health Innovation, Leadership and Learning (CHILL) in Nottingham University Business School have been studying this problem, and in this seminar we share learnings which are applicable to a wide range of organisations. Put simply if you can innovate, and spread innovation in health care, you can innovate anywhere. Professor Stephen Timmons, Professor of Health Services Management shares what CHILL has learned about how to promote and spread innovation in this most complex environment, and how other kinds of organisations can use these ideas. This recording is from our Nottingham University Business Alumni Insight Seminar series. Keep up to date on the latest NUBS alumni events. Speaker: Professor Stephen Timmons, Professor of Health Services Management NUBS Deans Professor David Park, Professor Kok Wei Khong and Professor David Goodwin reflect on the business environment and how NUBS is looking to the future. Dr Marie-Claire Peakman shares her approach to embracing new opportunities and developing an innovative mindset.

The workplace changes introduced in response to Covid-19 have provided the opportunity to reset team dynamics."
