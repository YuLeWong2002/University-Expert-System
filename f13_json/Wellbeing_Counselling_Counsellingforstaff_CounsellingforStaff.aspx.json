            "p": "The University Counselling Service is also available for all staff. Our confidentiality policy applies equally to staff and students and our notes will not form part of your employment record. You may refer yourself to the service or may be encouraged to seek our help by your line manager or human resources. It will remain your choice to attend the service. Appointment should be made during regular working hours with minimal requests out of these hours, (i.e. during lunch hour 1pm-2pm) and must be requested one day in advance. For most staff it is possible to negotiate with line managers to allow attendance at appointments. Staff may wish to consult the 'Policy for Psychological Wellbeing and Avoidance and Management of Stress'. We are unable to offer counselling to families of staff. Seeing a counsellor has a lot of advantages. Unlike talking to friends and family members, counsellors don't judge you and they work within a set of boundaries and confidentiality. Together you and the counsellor will determine clear goals and direction for a counselling session to work. Counsellors respect the boundaries you want to work in except in cases where concerns of safety become an issue. Some worry that counsellors work for the organisation rather than for the individuals in the organisation. This is a false concept and we ensure that confidentiality offered is in its strictest form. If you have concerns, please feel free to consult us initially with no personal questions asked. It is normal for someone to struggle with significant issues at certain stages in his/her life. Issues include: There may not be a particular reason but one may lose both meaning and purpose in life. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8001"
