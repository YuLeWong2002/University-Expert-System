            "p": "Health Economics Research at Nottingham (HER@N) brings together researchers with a shared interest in health economics across the University of Nottingham. The network seeks to facilitate collaboration between different research groups and wider dissemination of health economics research findings. Economistsâ€™ skillsets can be applied to a variety of questions regarding policies, interventions and fundamental concepts that determine the health of the public. Health economists working at the University of Nottingham are involved in research that employs a wide range of methodologies applicable to an extensive selection of clinical fields. A lot of our work involves trial-based and model-based economic evaluation to estimate the cost-effectiveness of health interventions. We also carry out work in public health economics and conduct econometric analyses of large data sets.
