            "p": "University Park Campus, Nottingham, UK Do you feel there is more to the past than just the UK’s perspective? Are you ready to examine history through the lens of other cultures, other ideologies and other languages? This course allows you to combine your passion for language learning with your curiosity for exploring the past. Through combining one or two European languages with history you’ll gain access not only to additional source texts, but also a whole new way of understanding the societies and cultures of contemporary Europe. Many of our students say the year abroad is their course highlight. Not only do you have the opportunity to fully immerse yourself in the language and culture of your chosen country/countries, but spending time abroad can make you more independent and confident. Taking yourself out of your comfort zone won’t only benefit your degree, it’ll shape the person you are to become.

It is one of the UK's most beautiful and sustainable campuses, winning a national Green Flag award every year since 2003. I’ve found studying two subjects so rewarding. You get to study things from different perspectives which you probably wouldn't be able to do as much as a single honours student. If you want to study more than one subject, you aren't being indecisive and you won't regret it! Ellie Abbey 85% of students say teaching staff have supported their learning well.
