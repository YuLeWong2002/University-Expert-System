            "p": "British higher education combines tradition and academic study, with cutting-edge thinking and a global perspective. With a strong reputation for research, innovation and creativity, British universities attract some of the world’s leading academics and many of its brightest students.Degrees from English language institutions are highly regarded around the world and Britain's higher education system is renowned for high academic standards. By studying in Britain, you will develop a valuable perspective on the world we live in. Studying in another country can give you an edge in a competitive global job market and demonstrates that you are mature and adaptable. If you are thinking ahead to your career plans, many degree courses at British universities are shorter than equivalent courses in other countries. For example, most bachelors degree courses can be completed within three years. Mastering the English language is a skill you can use around the world. Whether you struggle with English or are nearly fluent, our Centre for English Language Education offers a range of options for you to develop your English skills. Many students choose the UK as a place to live and study because of Britain's famous history and culture, along with its welcoming and multicultural society. The beautiful countryside and easy transport links provide exciting travel opportunities for vacation periods. Research into attitudes towards international students in the UK found high levels of integration and acceptance. #WeAreInternational is a social media campaign bringing together universities across the UK who are committed to maintaining a diverse, inclusive community. International students often find that the British style of teaching is different from what they are used to. Learning is interactive and you will be encouraged to contribute ideas and think for yourself. This will develop valuable skills for career and personal development. English people are so polite! I love that so much about England, I think it is something about which we can all learn. I also think that English people take very good care of their heritage sites, gardens and everything in general and that they are always looking for ways to improve what they do.
