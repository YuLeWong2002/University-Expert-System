            "p": "Registration for our winter 2024 ceremonies has now closed. If you haven't registered a choice of how you would like to graduate, as long as you are eligible, you will automatically graduate in absentia and receive your certificates and transcripts through the post following our December ceremonies. For those that have registered to attend their ceremony, extra guest tickets may be available to purchase on the day. Visit our guest tickets page for more information. Guest tickets We want to ensure your day is as accessible, inclusive and enjoyable as it can be for both you and your guests. If there are any adjustments we could make to help achieve this, please let us know. See our accessibility page for more information. If you or your guests require a visa in order to attend graduation, you will need to request a letter called a Confirmation of Student Status Letter (which will include your predicted graduation date). We recommend printing out the email you received inviting you to graduation as proof of your ceremony invitation, as this will also be required. Request a Student Status Letter Registration is also your chance to tell us if youâ€™d like to stay connected with the university after you graduate. Want to continue your learning and get access to top tips from leaders in your sector and beyond? How about webinars to develop your professional skills, masterclasses hosted by experts in their field, seminars led by academics, and networking opportunities with your global alumni community? Simply opt-in to receive communications from your Alumni team when you register for your graduation ceremony to hear about these exclusive opportunities and so much more."
