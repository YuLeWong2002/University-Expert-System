During your first three years, you'll have approximately 16 to 18 hours of teaching contact time with around 20 hours of independent study per week. You'll spend around five days on placement each semester. During your time in the Clinical Phase, you'll spend between 35 to 40 hours across five days every week studying and on placements. You'll spend around three to four days on ward, clinic or GP placement visits per week plus 8 hours of independent study time. This will include some out of hours work. Your holidays will also differ during the Clinical Phase from the standard student timetable. You'll have about six weeks' holiday in each of the clinical phases. This is usually taken as two weeks at Christmas, two weeks at Easter, and two weeks during the summer.

The University of Nottingham is consistently named as one of the most targeted universities by Britain’s leading graduate employers (Ranked in the top ten in The Graduate Market in 2013-2020, High Fliers Research). Our Medical School is based in Queen’s Medical Centre, one of the UK’s largest hospitals. There are dedicated clinical skills facilities including a dissection suite and teaching laboratories for medicine and healthcare students. I love studying medicine at Nottingham because of the overwhelmingly friendly atmosphere. Everyone is so keen to support you on your journey to become a doctor. Outside of the fantastic academic course, there are so many extra-curricular opportunities to get involved in, a lot of which are co-ordinated by MedSoc. This is a student-run society that manages over 60 clubs and societies, organises a whole host of events and focuses heavily on welfare. I can’t recommend Nottingham Medical School enough.
