            "p": "The Clinical Research Theme brings together clinicians working at the affiliate practices who are primarily responsible for the health and welfare of a diverse range of species, from cats and dogs to horses, sheep, cattle, and primates. Within the theme, the School is developing a veterinary tissue Biobank to facilitate collection of residual clinical material from diagnostic investigations and surgery, such as ovaries, tumours, blood and synovial fluid samples. The samples are obtained with owner consent, and then made available to researchers. Much of the clinical research is patient-oriented, studying mechanisms of disease, and potential therapies through clinical trials. Research interests include investigating the epidemiology of diseases within specific populations of owned animals, and understanding how owners and vets make decisions relating to the health and welfare of their animals. Clinicians are ideally placed to facilitate translational research, and are at the forefront of the 'One Health' initiate, through collaborations with basic scientists. Current collaborations include the study of the comparative oncology of osteosarcoma, melanoma and mammary cancer, electrolyte changes and anaemia in cats with heart failure, and the biomechanics of locomotion.
