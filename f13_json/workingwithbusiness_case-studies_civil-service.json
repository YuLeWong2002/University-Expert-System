            "p": "Civil Service The Civil Service is a unique organisation providing a huge range of career opportunities for talented graduates. Their work impacts every aspect of society with more than 420,000 staff working in diverse areas across the UK. The Civil Service Fast Stream offers an award-winning graduate leadership development programme. To meet the needs of an increasingly diverse society, they need to attract, develop and retain talented people from all backgrounds to become their future senior leaders. They contacted our Careers and Employability Service to help them to develop a strategic approach to recruitment and to make the most of their budget. The University’s Careers and Employability Service provided a dedicated account manager as a single point of contact for Civil Service Fast Stream. The Civil Service recruits from all disciplines and wanted to talk to students from a range of subject areas. We worked in partnership to develop a strategic programme of events to get them in front of and engaged with our students. These included: Civil Service Fast Steam attended nine careers events over the course of 2018/19, leading to a significant increase in applications from our students. There was also a big increase in applications from BAME students. The University and Civil Service Fast Stream meet regularly to review progress and to help target the most appropriate upcoming events. We’ve now been working together closely for more than five years. - - - Find out how our Careers and Employability Service could help your business.
