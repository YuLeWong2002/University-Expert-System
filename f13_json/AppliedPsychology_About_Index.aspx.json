            "p": "The Institute of Work, Organisation and Wellbeing first opened its doors at the Malaysia Campus as the Institute of Work, Health and Organisations (IWHO) in December 2006 offering postgraduate Masters degrees in management psychology and occupational health and safety leadership. Since then, it has introduced the University’s first ever undergraduate programme in applied psychology and management, as well as MPhil/PhD degrees in applied psychology. As part of the UNMC’s strategic plan for 2013 onwards, the Institute has been rebranded as the Institute of Work, Organisation and Wellbeing (DoAP), in order to better reflect its broader teaching and research agenda, whilst maintaining independent status within the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences. The department recognises the potential for growth and development of applied psychology in Asia and actively promotes the contribution of applied psychology to industry and society, occupational and public health and safety, and to the management of related health-related services. It’s core teaching and research are in the following areas: telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8693 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8020"
