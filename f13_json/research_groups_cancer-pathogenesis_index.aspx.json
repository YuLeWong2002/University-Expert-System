Our goal is to advance the prevention, diagnoses and treatment of cancer in people and companion animals. We use a variety of genomewide approaches including next generation transcriptomics and epigenomics in combination with metabolomics, histopathology, immunohistochemistry and clinical integration to understand the cellular mechanisms which endow cancer cells with malignant potential Through collaborations with physicians at the Queens Medical Centre and major cancer hospitals in the United States and Europe and with our colleagues in the clinical research theme, we are identifying novel molecular mechanisms underlying some of the most aggressive and dangerous cancers.
