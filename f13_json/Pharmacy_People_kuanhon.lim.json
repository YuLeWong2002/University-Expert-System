We also pursue the total synthesis or semisynthesis of biologically active natural products. We carry out structural modification of natural products to understand the relationships between the molecular structure and its biological activity. We study natural products and novel structures for application in treatment of cancers, hypertension, and other disease-states. The major class of natural products that we are studying are alkaloids. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8018"
