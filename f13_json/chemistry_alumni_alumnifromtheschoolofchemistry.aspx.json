            "p": "The School of Chemistry encourages students who have graduated from Chemistry to keep in contact. Our graduates can become actively involved in the on-going development of an alumni community at Nottingham. The University has an Alumni website where you can log-on and catch up with old friends and receive a Nottingham email address for life. We have our own Chemistry Alumni webpage here, where you can keep directly in touch with the School. Would you be able to come back to the School as a Visiting Speaker? We hold a Careers Evening during October each year and welcome recent graduates back to the School who are willing to talk about their career to our current cohort of students. Please contact us if you would be willing to give a talk. We are always looking for student profiles that share information about your course, your time at Nottingham or your career progression since graduating. Please contact us if you would be willing to be featured in a student profile on our School website. You can use the alumni webpages to set up a regional network or organise an alumni event to meet up with your graduating class.
