Our course builds your knowledge in food structure and processing, with specialised modules in microbiology, marketing and society available to enable students to be part of the solution to future demands. What is food science? What you'll study We'll teach you the science behind the food we eat. You'll learn how to create sustainable, nutritious and safe food. This applied science degree can lead to jobs in research, operations and management. Mandatory Year 1 Essential Study Skills Fundamentals in Food Science and Nutrition An Introduction to Genetics and Biochemistry Introductory Physiology Sustainable agriculture, food and nutrition The above is a sample of the typical modules we offer, but is not intended to be construed or relied on as a definitive list of what might be available in any given year. This content was last updated on Monday 16 December 2024. Due to timetabling availability, there may be restrictions on some module combinations. In your first year, you will take 120 credits in core modules. As a guide, one credit equals approximately 10 hours of work. You will spend around half of your time in lectures, seminars and practicals. The remaining time will be independent study. Core modules are typically taught by professors, associate professors and assistant professors. PhD students may support teaching on some modules.

The University of Nottingham is consistently named as one of the most targeted universities by Britain’s leading graduate employers (Ranked in the top ten in The Graduate Market in 2013-2020, High Fliers Research). Sutton Bonington Campus combines world-leading laboratories with a countryside location, just a few miles from the city of Nottingham. The campus is home to over 2,500 biosciences and veterinary medicine students. In the second year module ‘Processing and Sensory Evaluation of Food’, we have looked at how we measure the sensory properties of food, along with looking at how foods such as chocolate and cheese are manufactured. I have really enjoyed this module as I have been able to use the Food Processing Facility to practice manufacturing different food products and we have been able to see the unit operations required to transform the ingredients into the final food product. This has given me such a valuable insight into food manufacturing and helped me to develop my practical skills further.
