            "p": "Information below is for students who normally live in England and will apply for funding from Student Finance England (SFE). Students who normally live in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland should check what is available through the relevant funding body. What do I need to do? The grant is means tested on your household income and can be up to 85% or your actual childcare costs, with a cap of £192.62 per week for one child or £331.95 per week for two or more children in 2024/25 If you or your partner receive the childcare element of working tax credits/universal credit you will not be eligible for the Childcare Grant from SFE. The Adult Dependants Grant of up to £3,438 in 2024/25 will still be paid in three instalments over the academic year. This grant is for when you have an adult who is financially dependent on you. The dependant adult must have a net income of under £3,796 per year to qualify. The Parents' Learning Allowance (PLA) is a means tested grant of up to £1,963 in 2024/25 if you have one or more dependent children, regardless of the age of the children. You do not have to receive the Childcare Grant to be eligible. The PLA is to help cover some of the additional costs incurred by students with dependent children; eg higher travel costs, books and equipment, and is paid in three instalments alongside with other maintenance support.
