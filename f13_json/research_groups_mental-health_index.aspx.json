With an estimated one in four people experiencing a mental health problem at some point in their life, research in this field is increasingly important. Bringing together leading academics in this field, our world-leading research aims to improve the lives and experiences of those with mental health problems, along with their families, friends and carers. Across several specific themes, our work promotes social inclusion, improves services, influences policy and develops practice. To find out more about how our research makes an impact, explore the group’s research themes and projects. This field, pioneered at Nottingham, investigates the relationship between arts, humanities, healthcare, health and wellbeing. Our research focuses on the way in which mental health services are organised, developing training and new interventions that support personal recovery and wellbeing. Research in this theme covers several areas including psychological interventions, social cognition models of health-related behaviour, and mental health and wellbeing in the workplace.
