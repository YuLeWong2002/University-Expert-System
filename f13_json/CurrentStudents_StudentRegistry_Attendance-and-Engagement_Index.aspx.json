            "p": "Students must attend all teaching activities necessary for the pursuit of their studies, undertake all associated assessments and attend meetings and other activities as required by their School or the University. Where students wish to interrupt their study, they should follow the University's procedure on Voluntary Interruption of Study. Retrospective interruption of study is not permitted. The intention of this attendance procedure is to ensure that students are engaging appropriately with the University and to provide a framework for managing non-engagement.
