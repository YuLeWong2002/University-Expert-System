            "p": "University Park Campus, Nottingham, UK Contemporary political ideas and practice are heavily influenced by modern history. For example, the political institutions and culture of contemporary America and France can only be understood with reference to the American and French Revolutions of the late 18th century. Politics and history are complementary disciplines. Both explore the nature of power across time and offer a critical understanding of the world today. They use many different methods of research and analysis, opening the door to a wide range of exciting careers. You will use primary and secondary historical sources to research, write and debate history. You'll also learn how to compare and contrast different political institutions, systems and behaviours. The second year module, 'History and Politics: A Problem or Solution?', is specifically designed for this course. It explores the overlaps and tensions between the two subjects, setting you up for more advanced study in year three. It sits alongside optional modules in both history and politics, covering a wide chronological and geographical range.
