            "p": "Philosophy is our attempt to understand the world around us and our place in it. It engages with science, history, and literature to develop and assess concepts of reality, truth, justice, and identity. Our teaching builds on our diverse research specialisms, covering practical issues in social identity and mental health, through to abstract concepts of time, truth, and consciousness. Our courses have a global approach, including Asian, African, and Western philosophical traditions. Theology and Religion, also studied in our department, are about making sense of the stories and practices people live by. We specialise in Christianity and Islam and also examine Judaism, Buddhism, and other traditions. We explore how religion intersects with social justice, technology, and the natural world, as well as philosophy, sociology and history. Our degrees open doors to many different career paths and provide key skills and perspectives for addressing the challenges of our time.
