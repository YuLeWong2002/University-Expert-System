            "p": "The School of Physics and Astronomy is a research led school, with our research informing our teaching. The School of Physics and Astronomy maintains a strong position in the upper quartile of the Physics Unit of Assessment, with an increase from REF2014 in the percentage of both ‘internationally excellent’ and ‘world-leading’ outputs, with more than a doubling of the percentage assessed as ‘world-leading’. The impact case studies submitted had an increase in those rated as ‘outstanding’ and the research environment also recognised being at least ‘internationally excellent’, with an increase to 75% ‘world-leading’ compared to REF2014. We: We house a wide range of research equipment available to staff and students. Staff finder Fellowships PhD projects Apply for a PhD For all of our research degrees, the first step is to identify one or more supervisors you would like to work with. To do this, look through the Research groups and our academic staff research interests. We strongly encourage contacting supervisors before making a formal application, to discuss potential research projects and to ensure the best application possible. More application information can be found here. World-class talent, working in multidisciplinary teams and with inspiring leaders, are at the heart of capturing new ideas and translating these into world-changing solutions. As a research-led institution, the University of Nottingham recognises the value and contribution of early career researchers in delivering its ambitious, high-quality research vision.
