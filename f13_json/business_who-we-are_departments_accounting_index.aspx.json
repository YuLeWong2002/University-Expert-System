Accounting is taught at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, with several of our undergraduate modules accredited by major professional accountancy bodies. The Accounting Department engages in high-quality teaching in mainstream accounting subjects, and in research that is interdisciplinary across related subjects, such as governance, taxation, auditing, climate change and various related aspects of law. Also, we work more generally in areas that have a wide remit in reference to accountability issues contributing to policy and organisational practices. Our programmes are grounded in accounting and the accounting profession and develop studentsâ€™ critical understanding of the roles of accounting in organisations and society, equipping them to contribute to a sustainable world.
