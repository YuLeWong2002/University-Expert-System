            "p": "The CBS Researchers Forum is a voluntary committee of postdoctoral and technical staff with postgraduate students that aims to represent and support non-tenured research staff within the Centre for Biomolecular Sciences (CBS). We try to encourages collaboration and a feeling of association between researchers from all levels in the CBS. This shall be achieved by publishing interesting articles around life in the building and organising social and scientific events. A pillar of this effort is the Annual CBS Research Symposium, which shall showcase the high class science done in CBS. It is the dawn of a new and improved CBS Researchers Forum. Do you have an interesting scientific story to share? Are you particularly interested in Outreach and would you like to tell people about your latest success? Tell us about your new lab equipment or latest news and we will get your message out there using our Facebook group or our Twitter account. The news we share should encourage people in the Centre for Biomolecular Sciences to learn more about their peers and who knows, maybe we will even see the advent of some fruitful collaboration! There are no results that match your criteria. Do you have something you would like to share with us? Do you have an idea how to improve your life as a researcher in CBS? Do you want to organise an event for the people in CBS?
