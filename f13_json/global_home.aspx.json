            "p": "In 2012, The Times described Nottingham as “Britain’s first truly global university”. Since then, we have consolidated this position and moved from being a university with the boldest of visions to establish overseas campuses, first in Malaysia and then China, to one which has built on this vision and developed it into a core part of its being. It is our ambition to move beyond this and become known across the world as Britain’s foremost global university. A university which continues to innovate and lead in the ever-competitive global higher education sector. One which thinks and acts both locally and across borders and cultures to promote the development of a global mindset as an integral part of the Nottingham student and staff experience. A university which becomes the destination of choice for the brightest and internationally curious minds. Our Strategic Priorities describe initiatives which will support staff and students on our campuses in the UK, China, and Malaysia in achieving this ambition together. Strategy Study Abroad International Students Partner visits Visiting Researchers Nottingham is a founding member of the Russell Group of universities in the UK, and a member of Universitas 21 through which we continue to find new ways of collaborating across borders.
