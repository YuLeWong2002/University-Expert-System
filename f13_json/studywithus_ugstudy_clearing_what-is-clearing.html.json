            "p": "Clearing is an opportunity for a fresh start. In July and August, many universities will still have vacancies for undergraduate courses starting in September. If you aren't holding any UCAS offers, or you've changed your mind about where or what to study, you can apply for these courses through Clearing. There are a few reasons why you might want to apply through Clearing. If you haven't got an offer from your UCAS choices, you're starting to rethink your original choices and apply for something different, or if you're applying for the first time this year, Clearing is ideal for you. You may not be confident in your results, or you might still be deciding what you want to study. Clearing lets you choose the right university and course for you. Clearing opens in early July for people who already have their results and some universities and courses will have Clearing vacancies available then. Some other Clearing vacancies may not open until A-level results day. At Nottingham, we typically offer some courses in Clearing at both of these times and have separate lists of vacancies for UK and international students. You can only apply for Clearing places once you have received your final academic results.
