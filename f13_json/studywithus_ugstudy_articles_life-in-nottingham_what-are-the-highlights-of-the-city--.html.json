Some of the famous night spots are: Rock City: a great spot for indie bands and the general club experience.

Major cities tend to become concrete jungles. The greenery they do have usually ends up being restricted to a handful of parks. Nottingham has managed to hold onto its greenery throughout the years of development and urban expansion. It’s important to be able to “get away from it all” and one of the popular ways to do that is to get out among the trees and the grass.

It’s good to know that Nottingham provides its people with plenty of access to a range of green spaces to provide that balance. Nottingham has its own signature cultural identity.
