            "p": "One of the main methods used to obtain student feedback from all students is through anonymised Student Evaluation. Evaluate is a new wireless, 'in class' tool used to capture Student Evaluation of Teaching (SET) and Student Evaluation of Modules (SEM) data. Evaluate will be available from September 2014. We seek feedback in two key areas: An evaluation of an individual lecturer, usually seeking comment on that staff memberâ€™s teaching as delivered in one particular teaching session. For SET, the numerical scores derived from the standard questions are fed back to the lecturer and the Head of School. In cases where the scores are poor, the member of staff may be asked to discuss these with the Head of School or another member of staff. SET scores are considered when a staff member applies for promotion or for confirmation in their employment. The open-ended comments remain confidential to the member of staff. SET scores per school and campus are analysed to identify any strengths or weaknesses and to allow good practice to be shared. An evaluation of the learning experience over the duration of an entire module and focusing on the learning resources and learning outcomes of the module. For SEM, the feedback is considered during the module review process and comments or issues are raised and attempts made to improve the module for the next delivery.
