            "p": "Although we have a large student population in Nottingham, university students make up only about 12.5% of Nottingham's total population, and in outlying areas, it's even less. Many of your neighbours may have to be up early for work, have young families or might be elderly. Even in some of the areas with high student populations like Lenton, Dunkirk, Radford and Beeston, there are a number of long-term residents living there too. It's important to remember that you are part of a diverse community and our neighbours may have different lifestyles and are unlikely to welcome loud noise or parties. Be a Clean Champion and pick up a bit of litter and put it in the bin."
