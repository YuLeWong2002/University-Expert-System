            "p": "Assistant Professor, Dr. Toh's research interest is on one of the known no-go theorem in quantum physics, i.e. Kochen-Specker theorem which stating that the only hidden variable theories allowed by quantum physics are contextual ones. Besides, he is also interested on the research about the thinking skills used in physics learning. Dr. Toh is a former physics education columnist who began writing an education column two years ago (March 2020) for Oriental Daily till now. He has more than 20 years of teaching experiences and serves Department of Foundation in Engineering since 2009.
