            "p": "The university has a gender split of 43.5% male employees to 56.5% female employees. Although there is still a higher percentage of female employees within quartiles 1-3, the percentage of female staff occupying some of the highest paid roles (quartile 4) has increased by 0.7% since 2022. Changes applied to locally negotiated pay scales level 1 to 3 in August 2022 continues to have a positive impact on pay for employees in the lower quartiles contributing to the reduction in the gender pay gap. In this reporting year, 23% of university employees were from a racially minoritised background which has increased by 6.2% since the previous reporting period. The number of racially minoritised employees occupied in all 4 quartiles has increased in 2023, whereas the number of White employees occupied in all 4 quartiles has decreased since 2022. This is the first year that the university have reported on Disability pay gap data, meaning that analysis of year-on-year changes is not currently available. However, the latest data shows that the university employ a higher number of employees who are not disabled (79%) in comparison to those who are/have declared they are disabled (15%). The remaining 6% of employee data is unknown and has not been declared either way."
