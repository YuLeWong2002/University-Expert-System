            "p": "Integrative Systems biology advances our understanding of biological phenomena through the close collaboration between laboratory and theoretical scientists, who eventually develop mechanistic mathematical and data models that identify gaps in biological knowledge and propose hypotheses for laboratory testing. The laboratory results lead iteratively to refined models that have predictive value. The modelling may integrate phenomena at different physical scales or incorporates different branches of physics (e.g. biochemical thermo-dynamics, with fluid dynamics and materials science). The approach is analogous to that between experimental and theoretical physicists. Across the life sciences, with particular emphasis on Food Security, Animal Health and novel biofuels, team members apply informatics and modelling techniques: This requires individuals an overlapping set of multidisciplinary expertise in the various areas of biology, statistics, computer science and applied mathematics. Finding the parameter values for a bacterial-growth model from lab data using Monte-Carlo Markov-Chain optimisation. The video begins by showing the original lab results, over which progressively improving growth curves have been drawn.
