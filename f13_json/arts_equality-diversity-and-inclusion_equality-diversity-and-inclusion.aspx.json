            "p": "The Faculty of Arts aims to be a place where we all feel safe, supported, valued and can reach our full potential. Ensuring equal access to opportunities, removing barriers and disadvantage for everyone. Being reflective of the wider community and supporting representation. Valuing, respecting, and celebrating difference and building a sense of belonging. These principles, when put into practice, aim to create a happy and effective environment for everyone, where people are free to develop and thrive both personally and professionally. Our student community is an incredibly diverse one, comprising a vast range of identities, backgrounds and lived experiences. Learn about fellow students from different walks of life, understand a bit more about their university experiences, and find out how you can support each other.
