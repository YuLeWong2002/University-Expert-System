            "p": "EU nationals, and their family members, will generally be awarded a tuition fee loan by Student Finance where the student has pre-settled status and has 3 yearsâ€™ residence in the UK, Gibraltar, EEA and Switzerland (unless that residence was wholly or mainly for the purpose of education). Students who live in Ireland (Eire) should be able to access a tuition fee loan without pre-settled status. Those who have been granted settled status under the EUSS will generally be eligible for home fee status, tuition fee and maintenance support if they have been ordinarily resident in the UK and Islands for at least 3 years. Irish citizens are automatically treated as settled in the UK and do not need to apply for the EUSS, if they are living in England."
