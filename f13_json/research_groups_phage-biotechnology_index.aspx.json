            "p": "The application of bacteriophage to control and detect bacterial pathogens. Our work focusses on all aspects of the application of bacteriophage (viruses that specifically kill bacteria) natural, sustainable control of bacterial pathogens. Specifically their use, as natural biocontrol agents for bacterial pathogens within food production environments and in live animals prior to slaughter, the control of infection in animals as a veterinary therapeutic and in the application of bacteriophage as rapid diagnostic reagents. In addition there is a programme focussing on the exploitation of phage-encoded enzymes. Our aim to use our expertise in the biology and genetics of bacteriophage to exploit them for biocontrol, therapeutic and diagnostic applications. The group encompasses staff with a long track record in phage biology with interests in food-borne and veterinary pathogens. We have specific expertise to characterise the action of bacteriophage at molecular and physiological levels, to understand the impact of phage on bacterial population dynamics, in both biotic and abiotic environments. We also have experience of developing novel technologies for detection and eradication of bacteria. Predictive modelling to optimise phage intervention against Campylobacter in poultry (BBSRC).
