We have a ton of events that you can get involved with through the Leadership Academy and you can tailor your volunteering to match your tastes and get training to support you along the way! At University of Nottingham Sport, we're fortunate to have an outstanding portfolio of facilities that attract several major national and international events every year, including the Touch Rugby World Cup and the British Transplant Games. These events offer students the opportunity to volunteer in a range of support roles including ticketing, team liaison, media and officiating. The programme offers University of Nottingham students an ideal opportunity to gain real events experience working with a range of national and international organisations. Benefits and training vary by event; volunteers may be able to access training and event kit as examples. Our state-of-the-art facilities can be transformed to host sporting competitions and external events and can help you stage an event like no other. +44 (0)115 748 7000 sport@nottingham.ac.uk Find our opening times here."
