            "p": "Malaysia’s multilingual education system makes it a highly strategic country in which to conduct linguistic research. Our cross-campus, multidisciplinary research group utilizes the university’s unique tri-campus setting to conduct psycholinguistic research across disciplines such as Psychology, English, and Modern Languages and Culture, involving mono- and multilinguals of different linguistic backgrounds. We use multiple techniques (behavioural, eye-tracking, and ERPs) to conduct basic and applied research into human cognition and language, focusing on areas, such as bilingualism and multilingualism, language acquisition, recognition memory, word recognition, and speech perception. Research themes include the impact of language background on executive functions, processes that help us ignore distractions, suppress inappropriate responses, and shift performance across tasks. Other research focuses on how language background influences discourse comprehension and word recognition.
