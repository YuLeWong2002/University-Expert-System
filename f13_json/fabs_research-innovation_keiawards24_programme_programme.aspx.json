Here you will find the running order for the evening and information on all of our nominees and the awards. Running order and timings Shortlisted awards entries at a glance \"On 2 June 1928, as King George V and Queen Mary were set to open the Trent Building and declare University Park our new home, Sir Jesse Boot wrote: 'In each succeeding age the university will spread the light of learning and knowledge and will bind science and industry in the unity that is so essential for the prosperity of the nation and the welfare of our fellow citizens.' \"These comments are as relevant today as they were in 1928. Today we are also seeing the commitment to universities as an anchor point for innovation to drive growth and enhance lives both locally and nationally. \"I'm delighted to welcome industry and civic partners tonight alongside research funders and friends of the university. Many of you are involved with the shortlisted projects and it is this collaboration which enables our discoveries to solve complex business problems and address global challenges. \"This evening's awards are an opportunity to recognise and thank our talented, dedicated and inspiring colleagues who take the outputs of their research and turn them into new insights, policies, processes, products and companies. \"Congratulations to all our nominees and thank you to all colleagues who entered. I hope this evening helps us all to discover just some of the ways our incredible work is innovating our world and changing society and the economy for the better. \"Have a wonderful evening.\" Read the nominations Get in touch: research.innovation@nottingham.ac.uk Jubilee Conference Centre Jubilee Campus Triumph Road Nottingham, NG8 1DH"
