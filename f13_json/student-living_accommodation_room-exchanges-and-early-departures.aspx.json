            "p": "Find the campus that's right for you If you have found yourself in an exceptional circumstance, there are options available to you. It may be possible to change your room type or hall during the year, although it can take considerable time and we would prefer to discuss ways that your problems can be resolved without a move. The Residential Experience Team (ResX Team) are on hand to support you in your halls of residence. Each Hall has a dedicated team available when you need help and advice around the variety of challenges that you may be facing. You can contact ResX on 0115 748 7600. Please be aware that room transfers will not always be possible. If you are in catered halls and want to transfer within your hall to another room, please submit your request to your Welcome Point. Room moves within hall are subject to a Â£50 fee as per Clause 14 of your Licence Agreement. If you are in a University-arranged self-catered site and want to transfer within your site to another room, please submit your request to the site management team. Please note there will normally be an associated transfer charge. If you are moving to non-University-arranged accommodation or leaving the University early please see below: Please visit our Request to Terminate Licence Guidelines Discuss your request with your site management team and they will advise you. Please note You should normally expect to continue to pay for the full year's accommodation fee."
