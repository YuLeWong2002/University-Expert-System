Check the status of your application regularly to see if we've requested anything else from you. Track your application If you've applied for teacher training or MA Social Work, you can track your application through UCAS. If you already have your qualifications, you can upload scanned copies of your degree certificate and transcripts, as well as any other supporting documents. You may also need to provide two references, including at least one who can comment on your academic ability. It's a good idea to start exploring funding options once you've submitted your application. You'll need an offer of study before you can apply for some scholarships. But if you know what is available and what you are eligible for, you can plan your funding application and submit it as soon as you're ready. Information about scholarships and postgraduate student loans can be found in our funding guidance. If you have a question about your application, contact us."
