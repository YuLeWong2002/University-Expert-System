            "p": "Sparta Live! This week's event Dr Nancy Bouidghaghen (Dr. from the Université Sorbonne Paris Nord) What have the French scholars done for Sparta?: The French’s contribution to Spartan civilization The paper is based on my doctoral thesis at the Université Sorbonne Paris Nord and will explore the contributions of three French scholars to Spartan studies, François Ollier and his Mirage spartiate (1933-1943), Henri-Irénée Marrou and his Spartan Education in his book Education in Antiquity (1948), and Nicole Loraux and her beautiful Spartan death (1977). I will argue that the Spartan mirage and the beautiful Spartan death are two seminal concepts of Spartan historiography that have long structured our approach to Sparta and influenced the way we represent the Spartans. Henri-Irénée Marrou’s Spartan education is both a testimony to how Sparta was perceived for decades, but also a response, albeit with negative effects, to the misuse of Sparta by the Nazis. I will study the relationship/genealogy of thoughts on Sparta between these three scholars and how their present, their commitment against fascism and their own reflections on what a historian is have not only partially shaped Spartan historiography but are also still relevant today.
