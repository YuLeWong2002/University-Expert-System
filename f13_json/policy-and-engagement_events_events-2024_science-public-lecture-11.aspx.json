            "p": "For any questions about the science public lectures, please contact Hilary Collins or the Institute for Policy and Engagement. As the bacterial species responsible for plague, Yersinia pestis occupies a prominent place in human history as one of the most destructive infectious diseases known to humanity. It has claimed tens of millions of lives through a series of periodic pandemics including the infamous ‘Black Death’ (14th-17th century). Given the estimated number of fatalities which run into the tens of millions, Y. pestis is probably responsible for influencing human history like no other bacterial pathogen. Soil is considered an important environmental reservoir in which Y. pestis may adopt a ‘sit and wait’ lifestyle from where it can re-emerge. While this may explain where Y. pestis survives during non-epidemic periods, it does not explain the environmental and biological triggers that promote survival and re-emergence. This lecture will explore the history and biology of the plague and discuss the work being carried out by the University of Nottingham to uncover the drivers for plague inactivity and resurgence. This lecture is part of our monthly science public lecture series. These events showcase research from scientists at the University of Nottingham and are free and open to all!
