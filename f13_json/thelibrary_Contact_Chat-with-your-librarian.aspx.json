Drop-in to the new 'Chat with your librarian' sessions on Microsoft Teams and our staff will be happy to answer any of your queries--from library loans to using NUsearch to finding online resources. Please note that chat service is not available on weekends or public holidays. Questions received outside the scheduled chat sessions will be responded to by the next working day. Alternatively, you can email us at libraryservices@nottingham.edu.my, and we will reply you as soon as possible. Please email libraryservices@nottingham.edu.my if you would like to request/book for an online library user education session on Library Information Skills, EndNote, Mendeley, etc., via Microsoft Teams. These pre-booked online sessions will be held during office hours (Monday to Friday, 9am-5pm). Do follow our Twitter and Instagram account for more updates on library services.
