            "p": "Your Support Plan may include the ability to request coursework deadline extensions and alternative exam arrangements, such as exams in smaller venues, rest breaks and extra time. Other support that we can offer is detailed below and you can contact us by emailing Disability Support Services where you will be allocated a Disability Adviser to discuss your support with you. With the above support, we believe autistic students can flourish at the University of Nottingham, achieving success in their studies while enjoying university life."
