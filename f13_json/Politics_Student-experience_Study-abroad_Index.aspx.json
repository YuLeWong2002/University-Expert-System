            "p": "One of the most exciting things about studying with the School of Politics, History and International Relations is the range of study abroad options that are open to you. Students usually study abroad in their second year - and can choose from one of three programmes - which include study options in the UK, Europe, North America, and Australia. Want to stay within the Nottingham community? Study at one of our campuses in the UK or China? Thinking of something a bit further afield? How does a semester or year in France, the USA, Mexico or Australia sound? telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8253 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8019"
