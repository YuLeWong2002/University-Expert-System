The University is part of a regional HPC consortium consisting of the Universities of Aston, Birmingham, Leicester, Loughborough, Nottingham, Queen Mary, Warwick and Coventry. Funded by a £3.2 million pound grant from the EPSRC and aimed at users whose research falls within the EPSRC’s remit, this facility aims to offer a higher capability system to users whose needs aren’t met by their home university’s own provision. Access to this resource is via a quarterly call for applications. Approximately 7 million core hours are available each quarter for Nottingham researchers. To apply, please visit our HPC Midlands Plus SharePoint Page. For those researchers with the biggest needs, there are also other regional, national and international facilities available.
