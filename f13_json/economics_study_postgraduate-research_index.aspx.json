            "p": "The MRes/PhD is the normal route to a PhD in economics at Nottingham. It is an integrated programme consisting of a one-year Masters in Research followed by (up to) four years of study leading to a PhD in economics. Students wishing to apply for a PhD in economics are normally expected to apply to our MRes/PhD programme. In exceptional circumstances, for example, having already completed an MRes or having substantial research experience, you may ask to be admitted directly to the first year of the PhD without completing the preliminary MRes year. The school's Admissions Officer, Dr Maria Garcia de la Vega, can provide advice on your eligibility for this route. Our guide to applying Funding information Our MRes/PhD includes: Discover campus life with 360 degree images and videos on our virtual tour.
