            "p": "Our aim is to be a key player in providing ‘the’ propulsion system of the future. So, we've devised a series of interdisciplinary research projects that will significantly contribute to the innovations industry demands. Through collaborative projects that include colleagues from engineering, chemistry and physics, we will develop our knowledge and understanding of the materials, processes, machines and applications that will make greener, sustainable and carbon-neutral propulsion systems possible. Which materials will pave the way to support future sustainable transport? See how we’re exploring greener alternatives to components and hardware. Discover the innovations that could power carbon-neutral systems. See how we can deliver research with industrial and societal impact."
