            "p": "Important information on how to apply for your student visa. All international students must obtain a Student Pass (Visa) to study in Malaysia. Education Malaysia Global Services (EMGS) is a Company Limited by Guarantee (“CLBG”) under the purview of the Ministry of Higher Education Malaysia (MoHE). EMGS also acts as a one-stop centre mandated by the MoHE to manage all student pass applications. The Immigration Department of Malaysia issues all student passes. The University of Nottingham Malaysia does not have the authority to approve or reject your student pass application. All New international students will have the option of applying for their Visa Approval Letter (VAL) through the following methods: Option A: Applying via the UNM Visa Office Option B: Applying directly to EMGS Option A is the recommended method. However, students who opt for Option B can contact the UNM Visa Office if any assistance is required. All new international students applying for their VAL will be required to pay an additional fee of RM2,000 as a deposit. The Visa Office will refund this deposit fee once the student submits their passport for the student pass shortening/cancellation after completion of studies or graduating before returning to their home country. Therefore, the total processing fee is RM4,660 (RM2,000 deposit fee + RM2,660 visa processing fee). All these fees are payable via MyNottingham portal. All international students will not be required to undergo a pre-arrival medical examination based on the circular issued by the MoHE. However, all international students MUST fill up and sign-off the ‘HEALTH DECLARATION FORM FOR APPLICANTS' and submit it to the Visa Office for VAL application. As such, students will only undergo their post-arrival medical examination after arriving on campus with any EMGS registered panel clinics. Students who fail the post--arrival medical examination are allowed to appeal their case once. However it is subject to the approval by the EMGS panel clinic. All international students who are renewing their Student Pass (Visa) for the second year (subject to renewal) MUST meet the following criteria: Students can appeal for their visa renewal with supporting evidence. However, the Immigration Department of Malaysia reserves the right to extend or deny student passes for any period. i-Kad Renewals are done on a yearly basis and students must meet the following criteria: The Immigration Department of Malaysia reserves the right to extend or deny any i-Kad renewals. Failure to renew will lead to a cancellation of the student pass and students will be required to return to their home country, as stipulated in the guidelines. All international students having a student pass issued for a full duration of studies (3 years) will have to now return to their home country and reapply for a new VAL with the newly changed course from their home country. These students are required to shorten/cancel their current valid student pass, return home, provide an exit stamp from KLIA and re-apply for a new VAL. Students are not allowed to reapply while in Malaysia. This includes students who wish to transfer to another university to continue their studies. The university will NOT be responsible should the Visa Office reports back to the Immigration Department if the student fails to hand in their passport for the cancellation process. This can lead to their passport being blacklisted by the Immigration Department. All international students who defer, withdraw, terminated, and completed studies are required to shorten/cancel their present student pass before leaving the country. They are required to get advice from the Visa Office on the necessary formalities. This is in line with the directive from the Malaysian Immigration Department guidelines NOT allowing international students to return home before shorten/cancellation is carried out. Any student fail to comply this guidelines will have their passport being blacklisted by the Immigration Department and the University will have no control over this decision. All new international students must be issued with an Electronic Visa Approval Letter (eVAL) before arriving in Malaysia. The application process can take up to four to six weeks (4 to 6 weeks) so students are advised to submit their applications as early as possible and submissions are highly encouraged before the following deadlines.
