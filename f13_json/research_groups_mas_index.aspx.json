            "p": "The Mechanical and Aerospace Systems Research Group (MAS, formerly known as Gas Turbine and Transmissions Research Centre or G2TRC) aims to develop new technologies, analysis methods and understanding for complex mechanical and aerospace system, including transmissions architectures, improving efficiency and reducing adverse environmental impact. The group has world-leading expertise in fluid-flow and heat transfer; machine dynamics, materials engineering; and friction, wear and fatigue analysis at standard and elevated temperatures. Our work spans energy and transport systems, working at fundamental and applied research levels (Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs) 1 to 5) to solve societal challenges to ensure we can sustainably provide affordable and clean energy and decarbonise transport for future generations. One example is our work to provide knowledge and design tools to support cleaner and more efficient gas turbines, which is delivered in partnership with our Rolls-Royce UTC. MAS hosts the Rolls-Royce University Technology Centre in Gas Turbine Transmission Systems and serves several other industrial customers.
