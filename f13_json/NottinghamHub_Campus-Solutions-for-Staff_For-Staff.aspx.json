            "p": "All of the data displayed to students in MyNottingham is pulled from Campus Solutions, The University’s new student administration system. If a student makes changes to their data or completes a process in MyNottingham, this will then change the data in Campus Solutions – although in some cases staff may need to authorise the change. Changes made in Campus Solutions will also show in MyNottingham, ie there will be a unity of records between the two. The main live functionality for students is to view plan and course information, manage finances, request support and access other University systems and databases (via the portal). Support issues should, in the first instance, be raised with Faculty Offices, line managers or Professional Service contacts. If issues are unable to be resolved or are technical in nature, please contact the IT Service Desk. telephone: +603 8924 8000 fax: +603 8924 8001 email: enquiries@nottingham.edu.my"
