            "p": "Read about our chemical and environmental engineering society It’s no secret that university is a social affair, and what better way to socialise than by joining a society! ChemEnv Society is run by chemical and environmental engineering students and is the perfect way to socialise with your course mates, make new friends and have fun. We work closely with the department to forge a sense of community between the students, as well as share any industrial links and opportunities with our members. From pub quizzes to balls and our annual boat party to the Lady Trent black-tie dinner, you’ll never be bored. If you love sports then you’re in luck. Our Frank Morton event is a competition and celebration between chemical and environmental engineering students from different universities. It’s the perfect event to expand your network, explore a new city and make friends for life. Follow us on Instagram. Learn all about our engineering and architecture societies. 3rd year student Petru tells us about the opportunities available outside of studies. Watch Petru, as he talks about his favourite societies. He’ll give you the lowdown on all the types of societies and the best ways to spend your spare time whilst studying with us."
