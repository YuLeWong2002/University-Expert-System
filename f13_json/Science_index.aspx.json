            "p": "The Faculty of Science is currently comprised of six schools. Each school offers exceptional opportunities for undergraduates, postgraduates and researchers. We pride ourselves in innovative teaching methods and a commitment to cutting-edge, world-class research. All of our courses are taught in English and the degrees awarded are exactly the same as those in the UK. There are no results that match your criteria. Our working ethos is one of inclusivity and support that respects the dignity of both its staff and students. The Faculty of Science is delighted to be the first Institution in Malaysia to receive the Athena Swan Bronze award in recognition of its commitment to actively promoting equality of opportunity for all of our staff and students. This recognition is from the UKâ€™s Equality Challenge Unit. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8018"
