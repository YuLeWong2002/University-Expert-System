            "p": "Philanthropy is in the lifeblood of the University of Nottingham. Since the days of Sir Jesse Boot, whose gift of 35 acres of land allowed the foundations of University Park to be built, gifts from friends, partners and organisations have helped us become the world-class University we are today. We thank all our supporters and acknowledge their financial and gift of time contributions through the Rolls of Honour below for the University's 2023/24 financial year. We also thank all those who wish to remain anonymous. Those who have made an exceptional commitment, shown outstanding generosity or pledged a gift in their Will are celebrated through our College of Benefactors, Leadership Circle and Guiding Lights. In recognition of the generous individuals - alumni, staff and friends who have remembered the University of Nottingham with a gift in their Will during the University's 2023/24 financial year. We extend our deepest thanks to our donor friends - individuals who are not alumni of the University."
