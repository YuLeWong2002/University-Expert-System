While such news of development promises a much-desired face-lift and reinforcement of Penang’s economic prowess, it does come with a price that may only be apparent in hindsight. This is the story of the hills and the sea of Penang, highlighting the struggle of Mohd. Ishak, a coastal fisherman and Joleen Yap, a wildlife researcher on Dusky Leaf Monkey, taking on and finding a place in Penang’s ambitious development. Part B: A moderated discussion on the effect of changing landscapes and climates on fishing and fisher communities. Building on case studies from Penang and Bangladesh, this discussion will explore the evolution of both aquaculture and traditional fishing systems. It will examine the promise of the Blue Revolution and the role of regulations and certification in managing the remarkable growth of this sector and its impact on the na tural environment. telephone: +603 8924 8000 fax: +603 8924 8001 email: enquiries@nottingham.edu.my"
