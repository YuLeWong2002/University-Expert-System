            "p": "The project began in 2004 at the University of Nottingham and Xerte Online Toolkits was released under an open-source license in 2009. A global Xerte Community has since thrived and the project transitioned to become part of the Apereo Foundation in 2015. Millions of learners and tens of thousands of teachers and tutors now have access to Xerte in hundreds of universities, colleges, schools and organisations all over the world. The Xerte Project places three values above all else: Rapid content authoring for all levels of skill. Non-technical authors can assemble content using a comprehensive suite of templates. Web developers have access to JavaScript and CSS to create anything they like. We believe that simple things should be simple and that anything should be possible. Best of breed accessibility for interactive learning. Accessibility has been a cornerstone of Xerte since its inception and we aim to provide the benchmark against which all other authoring tools are judged. We are a friendly and positive global community of users and developers working together to produce high quality tools for the creation of media rich, interactive and highly accessible elearning content. At the University of Nottingham, Xerte is managed by the Learning Technologies Section who deliver training courses and offer user support and advice on the use of Xerte in teaching and learning. The team works closely with the wider open source Xerte Community and is always keen to develop new features to meet the needs of staff and students within the University. If you would like some help bringing your ideas to reality, then please do get in touch. A beginner's guide to working in Xerte The Xerte Project's community website Lenton Lane Nottingham, NG7 2NR"
