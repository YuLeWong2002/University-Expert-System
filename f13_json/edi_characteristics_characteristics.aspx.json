            "p": "The Equality Act 2010 provides a legal framework in order to protect the rights of individuals and advance equality for all. There are nine characteristics that are protected under the act. This means that you and everyone in the UK is protected under the law from discrimination, harassment or victimisation on the grounds of: Age, Disability, Gender reassignment*, Marriage and civil partnership, Pregnancy and Maternity, Race, Religion or belief, Sex and Sexual orientation. *At the university, you will see the term trans being used rather than gender reassignment. We recognise that trans people hold a variety of identities, some of which may not be related to gender reassignment, and that some people may identify as neither male nor female. Trans is used at the university as an inclusive ‘umbrella’ term for anyone whose gender identity and/or gender expression differs from the sex they were assigned at birth.
