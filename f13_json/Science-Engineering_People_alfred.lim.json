            "p": "Assistant Professor, MRes Course Director, PGR Coordinator, Admissions Officer, Dr. Alfred Lim obtained his PhD in Psychology and MSc in Information Technology from the University of Nottingham Malaysia. He has experience as a Data Scientist in the biotechnology industry with a key focus on cognitive assessment. Further training in interdisciplinary methodology was followed by a Fellowship in Computational Linguistics at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, where he developed an interest in applying high-performance computing to the field of psychology. Dr. Lim's research explores several directions of computational cognitive science, such as modeling human behavior in various learning, memory, and selective attention setups with the goal to explain how brains generate behaviors using mathematical models. • EEG • Eye-tracking • Machine learning • Computational modeling • Visual attention mechanisms telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8001"
