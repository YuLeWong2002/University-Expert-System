            "p": "The University of Nottingham reached a landmark in its long list of academic achievements in 2003 when Sir Peter Mansfield was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his work in the application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The award is shared with the late Paul Lauterbur from the University of Illinois. MRI has been compared to the discovery of x-rays in its significance to medicine, becoming an indispensable tool in medical diagnostics, drastically reducing the need for invasive surgery. There are over 60 million MRI scans carried out worldwide each year. The importance of Sir Peter's work led to the founding of the Magnetic Resonance Centre in 1991 - now named the Sir Peter Mansfield Magnetic Resonance Centre in his honour. Also in 2003, former University of Nottingham student and academic, the late Professor Clive Granger, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Economic Science. He spent 22 years at The University of Nottingham as an undergraduate, lecturer and professor before moving to the University of California in San Diego. The University is proud of its interdisciplinary approach to research which will continue to see developments in the field of MRI, as well as other key strategic areas of research including the follwing research Priority Groups: With the University's investment in new research, there are bound to be many more highlights in the future.
