            "p": "The School of Cultures, Languages and Area Studies is a vibrant community with academic, professional and social elements. We want to make sure that every student and every member of staff feels part of something bigger than themselves, and puts down roots both within the University and in the world beyond. From our highly successful school and college outreach programmes to which everyone in the school can contribute, to social events and academic conferences, we find ways to build a strong community."
