            "p": "We are committed to providing an inclusive, respectful and considerate community for everyone at the university. As part of our university community, we expect everyone to: We do not tolerate harassment, victimisation or bullying. Anyone who considers that they may have been the subject to any of these has the right to be listened to and to be given informed advice on how the matter can be resolved. There are usually a number of options. It can be difficult to talk about negative experiences, and anyone who feels they have been harassed, bullied or victimised is likely to want to speak to someone that they trust. For this reason, there are a number of different people within the University who have been specifically trained for this role. If you have been subject to - or have witnessed - harassment, bullying, victimisation or discrimination of any kind, please let us know by making a report via our Report + Support tool below. The Report + Support service is for staff, students and visitors to the university and allows you to report an incident or incidents anonymously. Alternatively you can request to speak to an advisor. Speaking to an advisor does not necessarily mean that you are making a formal report to the university - it enables you to access advice and support for yourself or someone else. You will be signposted to information on internal and external support, policies, guidance and campaigns. You may then decide that you want to progress with a formal report, and we will support you in this. All reports are handled in confidence and we will never share your details with any support services without your permission.
