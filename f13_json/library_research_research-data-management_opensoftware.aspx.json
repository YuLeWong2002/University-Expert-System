Software can be cited and referenced, it can be included in your ORCID and other profiles. - To ensure that the software is securely archived for future use. Software can easily be lost when researchers move institutions. - To encourage collaborations in the future. Other may want to use your software for their own research, or build on your software to create new uses. If you believe that your software is a commercial asset, instead of openly sharing your software you may be interested in commercially licensing it. For more information contact the IP Commercialisation Team. Research Data Management Depositing your software Software licenses are a specific set of licenses which allow you to set out the terms of use for your software.
