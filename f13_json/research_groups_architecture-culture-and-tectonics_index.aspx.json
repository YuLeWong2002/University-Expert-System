Our research has been applied to designing exhibition spaces (including the Dinosaurs of China exhibition at Wollaton Hall in 2017 and two museums currently under construction in China), analysing historical architecture (such as Lincoln Cathedral), and the design of novel lightweight and deployable structures at international expos and other events (through Knowledge Transfer Partnerships and consultancies). Projects span a range of scales and contexts, from individual components of buildings at a local level, through to large scale planning and management of landscapes and cities internationally.
