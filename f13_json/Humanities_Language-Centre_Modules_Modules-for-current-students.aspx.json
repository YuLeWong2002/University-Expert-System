Each 20 or 10 credit module normally has five to six hours tuition per week, covering speaking, listening, reading and writing. The courses which offer language studies can be found at A-Z course listing. Students who wish to study language without earning official degree bearing credits, are able to audit modules for a modest fee subject to their individual timetables and the availability of space in the relevant class. New students will be assessed by the teaching team upon their arrival in order to place them in the appropriate level. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8693 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8020"
