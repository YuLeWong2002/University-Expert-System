            "p": "Sport / News / Archers deliver in the key moments to win BUCS Outdoor gold This was exemplified by Sport scholar Louisa Piper earning a highly dramatic national championship by claiming first place in the women's recurve competition. Piper would end her round on a score of 842, the exact same score as her closest opponent - however, because Louisa had managed to hit more 10 targets during the competition the gold medal was deservedly hers. Alongside Louisa's efforts, her team mates Hannah Evans and Layla Nimmo also shot exceptionally well to earn top fifteen finishes, and these performances would secured the University of Nottingham trio the women's team title. At the same time as our female athletes were excelling, the University of Nottingham was also achieving in the men's competitions. Max Harding consistently found the centre of each target put in front of him to grab a closely fought second place in the men's compound competition, whilst Ewan Kennett shot gold to win a one arrow shoot off for silver in men's barebow competition. With plenty of success in the experienced categories, University of Nottingham novice archers would also step up at the championships with some exceptional results. Jago Elliott shot superbly to claim gold in men's longbow, while Eva Jessen smashed her way to the top in women's barebow. With Daisy Underwood putting in some great work with a recurve, these three archers also took home bronze in mixed novice team. We would like to congratulate everyone involved in the University of Nottingham Archery Club's success throughout this year - across both the indoor and outdoor seasons.

Shooting in difficult winds and rain at the official GB Archery facility in Lilleshall, the somehow still sunburnt team did an incredible job across 3 rounds and collected plenty of silverware for the University of Nottingham! +44 (0)115 748 7000 sport@nottingham.ac.uk Find our opening times here."
