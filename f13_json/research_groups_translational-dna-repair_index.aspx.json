            "p": "Our research's aim is targeting DNA repair for personalized cancer therapy. -- Dr Srinivasan Madhusudan, Head of Translational DNA Repair Group Chemotherapy and radiation are commonly used to treat cancer. However many tumours are resistant to such treatments because cancer cells are able to counteract the effects of therapy by utilising the DNA repair machinery to repair DNA damage induced by these agents. The focus of our research is to block DNA repair in cells and thereby enhance cancer cell death. This will lead to better response to treatments and improve patient outcomes. We are developing new biomarkers to predict who will respond to therapy and who will not. We are developing new drugs to block DNA repair and increase cancer cell kill. National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) Prize 2012 - Dr Rachel Abbotts Dr Rachel Abbotts, MRC Clinical Research Fellow at the Academic Unit of Oncology, MOL has won the National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) Prize for 2012. Rachel has been recognised for her excellent work on APE1 manipulation in PTEN/RAD51 deficient melanoma systems for synthetic lethality application.
