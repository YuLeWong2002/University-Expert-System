Other than in the circumstances described at paragraph 5 above or as set out in the Agreement, the University will not consider any requests from students to terminate their Agreement. 11. The Accommodation Office Manager will inform the student of its decision in writing within ten working days of making it. 12. If a student is unhappy with a Decision, they will be entitled to ask for a review of it by writing to the Head of Accommodation Services but must do so within 30 days of receiving the Decision. A Review Request will only be granted on the grounds that a student: 12.1 has a compelling argument to demonstrate that the Decision was unreasonable. Claims of this nature must be supported by evidence and a clear rationale for the unreasonable nature of the decision. Claims that amount simply to an expression of dissatisfaction with the decision will not be considered; 12.2 believes that a procedural irregularity has occurred in the handling of your Termination Request; or 12.3. is in possession of additional evidence which may have affected the Decision, but was unavailable at the time the Decision was made. 13. The Head of Accommodation Services or an individual acting on their behalf will consider the Review Request. They will not usually consider the issues afresh and will inform the student of their decision in writing within 30 days of receiving the Review Request. If the Director of Accommodation Services decides to uphold the Decision, their letter will constitute a Completion of Procedures letter which students can use to ask the OIA to consider their case."
