            "p": "The ALACS team has been supporting students at the university for 40 years. The ALACS team in the School of Education is offering you (both Home and International students) a wide range of in-depth, practice-based courses on vital skills, including writing successful assignments and dissertations, criticality, academic integrity, understanding feedback, effective presentation and discussion skills. There are also courses to develop important language skills such as grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation or social conversation. All courses are delivered by experienced and qualified tutors. For individual support to suit your needs, you can book our very popular one-to-one consultations. In May and June, you can book up to three courses and three consultations. We are here for you all-year-round from registration to graduation."
