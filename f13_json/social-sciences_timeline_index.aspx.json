            "p": "Our work in the social sciences began in the late 1700s with the opening of an adult education school here in Nottingham. Over the next 200 years, our people have been (and continue to be) the key to our success - changing government policy, working to understand societal issues and helping to solve global problems. Concerned with how the world works, social science is, in its broadest sense, the study of people and societies. It incorporates a diverse range of subject areas including business, economics, education, geography, international relations, law, psychology, politics, sociology and social policy. We are proud of the impact our research has had on the world. We have achieved amazing things and still have so much more to do! Watch our video to see how the story of Social Sciences at Nottingham unfolded.
