James Cameron-Gifford Library is now open 24-hours until 12 December, but we know that the library can get busy during peak times. To help provide you with more space to study, we’re providing access to additional spaces in the Lecture Block, opposite the library, between 21 October and 29 November. Each available room in Lecture Block will have a poster on it letting you know exactly what dates and times it is available for use as study space. You can also browse day by day availability on the Study here webpage. If you prefer to study in the library, you can book individual and group spaces up to seven days in advance using Click and Study. If you have any questions about finding suitable study space, please ask a member of the team at James Cameron-Gifford Library or email library-helpline@nottingham.ac.uk. Don’t forget to look after your health and wellbeing when studying. Our Learning Development team recommend setting yourself an achievable goal for your study session before getting some rest. Find more guidance on preparing for exams on our Studying effectively webpages. Wellbeing guidance and details of available support services can be found on the Current Students webpages. King's Meadow Campus Lenton Lane Nottingham, NG7 2NR Please see our Help and support page for telephone and email contact points"
