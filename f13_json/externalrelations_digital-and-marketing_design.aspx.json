            "p": "The university works with four key creative agencies, each of which offers design services for a range of collateral including digital assets, newsletters, magazines, posters, leaflets, flyers, adverts, banner stands and brochures. All pieces of the university's collateral must adhere to the brand guidelines to ensure consistency of tone, appearance, style and format. The brand guidelines provide guidance on logos, colours, imagery and tone of voice as well as advice on partnerships and co-branding, sub-branding and campaign-brands. To discuss your design requirements, please email the Traffic Manager. Contact details of the creative agencies on the university's roster are available on the Brand Resources SharePoint. Please note student recruitment marketing enquiries will be given priority."
