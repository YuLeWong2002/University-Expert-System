Each meeting will address a current theme in the field of languages education and will offer a stimulating range of inputs, discussions and an opportunity for the sharing of good practice and innovative thinking from members of our thriving languages community. Dr Abigail Parrish will share her research into student motivation to learn languages. Abigail is a Lecturer in Languages Education at the University of Sheffield and a former modern foreign languages teacher in schools in England. Arising from her teaching experiences, her research focuses on student motivation to learn a language, using self-determination theory, and the impact of choice, policy factors and student multilingualism.
