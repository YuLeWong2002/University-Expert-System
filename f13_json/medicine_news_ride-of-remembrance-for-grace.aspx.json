            "p": "Grace, a dedicated medical student, had a special connection with motorbikes, particularly her beloved Vespa. To pay tribute to her and to raise money for the Grace O’Malley-Kumar Foundation, the charity ride will take place on Sunday 19 May 2024, beginning from North Weald Airfield in Essex (gates open at 8am) and will conclude at a commemorative event (gates open at 12pm), which is open to all, with refreshment stalls, motorbike stands, music, and more at Newark Showground in Nottinghamshire. To participate in this ride of remembrance or to join the commemorative event, either on the main route or from distant locations across the UK, the registration fee is £10 per person or £15 if you're riding with a pillion passenger. This can be paid in advance at www.ticketsource.co.uk/grace-omalley-kumar-foundation or at the entrances to North Weald Airfield or Newark Showground on the day of the event. If paid in advance, please show your proof of purchase on arrival. All proceeds from the ride will go to the Grace O’Malley-Kumar Foundation.
