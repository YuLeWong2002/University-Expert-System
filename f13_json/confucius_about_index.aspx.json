Its principal remit is to develop and enhance educational, economic and cultural links between the UK and China. The Nottingham Confucius Institute is located at the Si Yuan Centre of the University's Jubilee Campus. It was awarded Model Confucius Institute Status in 2015 by Hanban in recognition of its achievements in promoting better understanding of Chinese culture and contemporary China through language programmes, outreach activities and community engagement. Its dedication to supporting academic, economic, technological and cultural exchange between the UK and China has also proved invaluable, helping to create opportunities for co-operation and development that will have a lasting impact.
