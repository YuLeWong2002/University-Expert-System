The University of Nottingham Food Systems Institute launched in Aug 2023 please visit their webpages for more information. Global food scarcity is a pressing problem. How can we help provide sufficient quantities of nutritious and palatable food to a growing world population within a changing environment? Our Beacon is an open research platform working across global food systems to deliver sustainable food and nutritional security. We are bringing together the power of genome-enabled plant and animal sciences with cutting-edge nutrition science, food processing, manufacturing and digital technologies. Our research is also driven by an understanding of the economic, legal, social, cultural, historical, and ethical issues that underpin and shape food systems. Building on 100 years of food systems research, launching 2023 We have researchers working on challenges across the food system Explore potential ways of feeding a growing population sustainably Our food policy work Explore more about Future Food and meet our researchers Learn more about jobs and fellowship opportunities Find out what's happening and how to get involved Discover our investments in new technologies and equipment that can boost your research Read our latest research in leading academic journals Find out about our equipment, data sets and protocols Find out about our doctoral training in international agriculture, in partnership with Rothamsted Research"
