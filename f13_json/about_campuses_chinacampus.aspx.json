The 140 acre Ningbo campus was opened to students in 2004 and was officially opened by John Prescott, the UK's Deputy Prime Minister, in February 2006. Like the Malaysia Campus, Ningbo Campus builds on the attributes of University Park in the UK and includes a lake and its own version of Nottingham's famous Trent Building. The campus provides purpose-built facilities for nearly 8,000 students, including: The new campus is situated on the Ningbo Higher Education Park, which also has excellent complementary facilities, including a new Municipal Library and Sports Stadium. All teaching is carried out in English and the degrees awarded are University of Nottingham degrees.
