            "p": "All students (Malaysian, International and Malaysian citizens) are mandatory to enrol, undertake, complete and pass the General Studies modules (formerly known as Compulsory Subjects) before they graduate. This is a precondition for the award of degrees in Private Higher Educational Institutions (PHEI) under the Private Higher Educational Institutions Act 1996 (Act 555). As a private higher educational institution, University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) is subject to PHEI regulations effective 1 September 2013 (Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Education Malaysia Administrative Circular JPT / GS1000-606 JLD.1 (30) dated 22 July 2013). IMPORTANT NOTE: All NEW students (starting from February 2022 INTAKE) enrolling for their Undergraduate studies in UNM will be required to enrol, undertake, complete and pass all the assigned modules in the 2022 NEW MPU Structure. However, the returning students who joined UNM before January 2022 will continue to undertake the MPU modules under the 2013 MPU Structure. Please be reminded that 2022 NEW MPU Structure is subject to change depending on the latest developments from time to time. Should you have any further enquires pertaining to General Studies modules/matters, please email to GeneralStudiesDepartment@nottingham.edu.my or see any of the administrative staff at the General Studies Department office (located at the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, EA30) for further assistance. There are no results that match your criteria. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8244 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8020"
