            "p": "The Criminal Justice Research Centre (CJRC) produces world-leading research and scholarship in criminal justice and criminology, aiming to promote research, public engagement and practice informed teaching. As a joint initiative of the School of Law and the School of Sociology and Social Policy, inter-disciplinary research is at the core of the CJRC. Members and associate members of the CJRC take a collaborative approach to research, and are assisted by an external Advisory Board of stakeholders. Our research in the areas of criminal justice and criminology has local, national and international reach and impact. The CJRC provides a hub for activities relating to criminal justice and criminology, hosting regular events such as seminars which contribute to public debates and encourage discussion between research, policy and practice. We are also proud to host the Criminal Justice Discussion Group, the annual Sir JC Smith Lecture on Criminal Law and Criminal Justice, as well as an active CJRC Postgraduate group called 'the Forum'. We also contribute to a range of experiential practice-informed teaching initiatives in relation to legal education and criminal justice in practice. This includes supporting the development of cross-school practice-informed teaching with key stakeholder agencies within the School of Law and the School of Sociology and Social Policy, as the basis for research into best practice experiential learning.
