Our BSc in mathematics will prepare you for a career in which you can apply the knowledge and skills you have learnt. The course will enable you to enhance and develop your transferable skills in project work, group study and presentations. Mandatory Year 1 Algebra Applied Mathematics Core Mathematics Probability and Statistics 1 The above is a sample of the typical modules we offer, but is not intended to be construed or relied on as a definitive list of what might be available in any given year. This content was last updated on Thursday 28 November 2024. Due to timetabling availability, there may be restrictions on some module combinations. The majority of modules are worth 10 or 20 credits. You will study modules totalling 120 credits in each year. As a guide one credit equates to approximately 10 hours of work. During the first year, you will typically spend approximately: You can attend drop-in sessions each week up to a maximum of two hours and the remaining time will be spent in independent study. In later years, you are likely to spend up to 15 hours per week in lectures and workshops subject to your module selection. In your first year you will meet with your personal tutor every week during term time. In small groups of 5-6 students, you'll run through core topics and practice working together in a group to solve problems and communicate mathematics effectively. All of our modules are delivered by lecturers or professors. PhD students sometimes support problem classes and computing workshops in their areas of expertise. Lectures in the first two years often include at least 200 students but class sizes are much more variable in the third year subject to module selection. Studying for a degree at the University of Nottingham will provide you with the type of skills and experiences that will prove invaluable in any career, whichever direction you decide to take.

The University of Nottingham is consistently named as one of the most targeted universities by Britain’s leading graduate employers (Ranked in the top ten in The Graduate Market in 2013-2020, High Fliers Research). University Park Campus covers 300 acres, with green spaces, wildlife, period buildings and modern facilities. It is one of the UK's most beautiful and sustainable campuses, winning a national Green Flag award every year since 2003. The main aspect of my course which I have enjoyed the most is the fact that it offers a wide range of optional modules in your second and third years. I enjoyed having a variety of topics such as pure based modules, applied mathematics and statistics and probability.
