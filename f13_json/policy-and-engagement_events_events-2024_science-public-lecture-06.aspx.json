Science Public Lecture AI and Chemistry: A Greener Future Artificial Intelligence is often portrayed as a scary algorithm that will one day destroy the world; but what about the ways in which it can save it? As the consequences of global warming become our bitter reality, we must learn to lessen our impact upon the environment by developing greener and more sustainable processes. This is particularly difficult in the chemical industry, as high energy demands and the production of toxic waste make day-to-day chemistry inherently polluting. Join us to learn about how we can use AI to address these problems and how we can encourage chemists to use our tools to make their chemistry greener!
