            "p": "Tuition fees by study level can be found on our fees and finance webpages. Please check the year of study to ensure you have the correct information. Once you have accepted your offer to study at Nottingham, you will be able to access the online payment section of your student or applicant portal. Here, you can pay your tuition fees by bank transfer or credit/debit card. Payment options If you are applying for a Tier 4 visa, tuition fee payments should be included on your CAS. If you make a payment after receiving your CAS, you will receive an automated email to confirm that your CAS has been updated with fee payments and we advise you to wait for this confirmation before applying for your Tier 4 visa application. Visa guidance If you have an official sponsor such as an overseas government, business, charity or trust, you must email your official sponsorship letter to our sponsorship team prior to, or at, registration via sponsorship-assistant@nottingham.ac.uk. We will then issue tuition fee invoices to your sponsor. The sponsorship letter must confirm that your sponsor agrees to pay your tuition fees for the full duration of your academic programme. If your sponsor issues revised sponsorship letters on an annual basis, it is your responsibility to ensure that updated letters are submitted prior to the start of each academic year. If you are spending one or two semesters at Nottingham, whether or not you pay fees – and how much – will depend on the programme you are taking part in. For details, see our exchange and study abroad information."
