            "p": "When are the timetabling deadlines? What are your procedures for timetabling? Why do we have clashes between teaching? Why can't the timetables be the same every year? can't we decide which rooms we want for our timetables? When should I vacate a room by? Where can I find the definitions of the timetabling codes and what the grid layout is showing i.e. building codes and activity name? What if I need to run an extra class? What do I do if there is a double booking? When is the Timetable Services office open? How to contact Timetable Services? As a member of staff, am I given an opportunity to comment on my timetable? Can you provide training for new members of staff? How are decisions about available teaching space made? What do I do if I want to cancel a teaching session? How do I request extra AV facilities? What times of day do you timetable?
