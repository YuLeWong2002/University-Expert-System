            "p": "Following the recent Government announcement, please be informed that where research needs to be conducted on campus, it should continue and all research facilities and laboratories will remain open to support this. Research staff should follow all Covid security measures, including the wearing of masks and weekly testing. Where research activities do not require access to University facilities, research should be conducted from home. Postgraduate students who are able to conduct their research from home are expected to do so, however, should there be a need to be on campus, please attend as normal. If it is not clear whether research can take place at home, students should check with their supervisor.
