            "p": "In Modern Languages, our teaching, learning and research is reflected in a wide variety of complementary activities, from talks by visiting writers and academics to student-led study groups, social events such as sports matches, student theatre, dance and other language-themed activities. Not only do we run regular events, we also work hard to engage the local community. In particular, we work with local schools and colleges to promote the study of Modern Languages and to express our passion and enthusiasm for our subjects.
