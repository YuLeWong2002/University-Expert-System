The University of Nottingham Malaysia (UNM) is a private higher educational institution established under the Private Higher Educational Institutions Act 1996 (Act 555) in Malaysia. UNM is one of a leading, global, research-led university with strong track record in research and technology development which always strives to improve and strengthen its capabilities in academic and research fields through collaboration with various parties and has taken various initiatives to make academic programs and related research project a success. The University has been collaborating closely with various academic organisations including the Malaysia Chapters for the International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research (IAHR) and the International Association for Coastal Reservoir Research (IACRR). The International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research (IAHR), founded in 1935, is a worldwide independent organisation of engineers and water specialists working in fields related to the hydro-environmental sciences and their practical application. Activities range from river and maritime hydraulics to water resources development and eco-hydraulics, through to ice engineering, hydro-informatics and continuing education and training. IAHR stimulates and promotes both research and its application, and by so doing strives to contribute to sustainable development, the optimisation of the world's water resources management and industrial flow processes. To enhance and promote communication and the exchange of knowledge at a national and local basis, IAHR supports the formation of National Committee of Malaysia Chapter. This Committee arrange conferences, seminars, workshops, produce newsletters, and make a strong effort to promote IAHR in Malaysia. The International Association for Coastal Reservoir Research (IACRR) was founded in 2017. It is an international nonprofit organization set up to promote and develop Coastal Reservoirs (CR). IACRR has members from various sectors such as engineers, scientists, researchers, industry players, suppliers, contractors, developers, water agencies, operators and decision makers. IACRR promotes the approach of CR as it is a paradigm shift in water resources development from storing water in inland dams to storing freshwater by the coast. This approach converts floodwater into valuable water resources closer to the demand centres. IACRR will be the platform for sharing of knowledge and experience to ensure successful implementation of CR worldwide. To enhance and promote communication and the exchange of knowledge at a national basis, IACRR also supports formation of the IACRR Malaysia Chapter. This Chapter arrange conferences, seminars, workshops, produce newsletters, and make a strong effort to promote IACRR in Malaysia. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8001 email: enquiries@nottingham.edu.my"
