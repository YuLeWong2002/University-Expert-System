            "p": "Dedicated to the analysis of American foreign relations, politics and culture The Centre provides a space for academics, students, policymakers, cultural producers, and stakeholders within and beyond Nottingham to collaborate on research, educational outreach, and impact opportunities in the field of U.S. in the World Studies. Our work reflects on the past and present of the United States, and considers issues of vital contemporary importance, ranging from climate change and energy security, to race and inequality, human rights and economics, technology and cultural representations, to peace, security, and the way that the world works, all of which inform and impact the U.S. and its role in the world. The Centre’s members write, teach and comment about the United States and the Global Cold War, race in U.S. history and politics, right-wing extremism, borderlands, transatlantic studies, and cultural and visual studies. They are interested in identifying pathways for research that adopt a broad international and interdisciplinary approach to understanding the United States. A vital part of the Centre’s work is in reaching out to key stakeholders beyond the University and providing a bridge between academic research and the wider community. Impact and Outreach activities will be focused on connecting with policymakers, engaging with teachers and schools, media work and expert commentary, and activities with a range of external partners such as museums, art galleries, theatres, and cinemas."
