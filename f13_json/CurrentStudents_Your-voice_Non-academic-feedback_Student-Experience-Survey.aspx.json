            "p": "As well as ensuring that there is dialogue and feedback in relation to teaching and learning related issues, we undertake an annual survey that allows us to benchmark against other institutions (and they against us). The igraduate Student Experience Survey is a tool where students can indicate how well the campus is doing at meeting their needs and responding to their requests. Because the same questionnaire is considered at many different institutions we can compare UNMC to other campuses and universities. We always want UNMC to come out well in these comparisons and seek to serve our students as best as we can, investing in new facilities and resources and providing the best in UK education in a SE Asian setting. In that regard, we have invested heavily in new infrastructure in 2013, to enable Nottingham students to be proud of UNMC. We know that there are always things that can be improved and we seek to find the views of students to identify the priority areas. Please do complete the Student Experience Survey which has been sent directly to your university email account and give us your feedback on the excellent resources available to you and lets see how we compare to other institutions locally and globally. You asked â€¦ We delivered. A link to the igraduate Student Experience Survey has been sent directly to your university email account, please remember to take the survey! telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8001"
