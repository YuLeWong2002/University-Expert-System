Our academic and performance activities are fully integrated into the dynamic musical life of the city of Nottingham. Dr Elizabeth Kelly Head of Department Folk duo Morris and Watson showcase their skills. Studying music and philosophy at Nottingham opened up opportunities for learning which I never expected. The enthusiasm and friendliness of the lecturers enabled me to gain the richest understanding of every topic. In addition, I had the opportunity to study in Hong Kong for a semester which made my experience of university even more unique.
