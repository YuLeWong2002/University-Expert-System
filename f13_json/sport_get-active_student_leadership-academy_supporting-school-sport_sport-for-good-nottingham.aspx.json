            "p": "Sport for Good Nottingham is a world renowned student-leadership programme that uses the power of sport to drive real social change in the local community. Through the Sport for Good programme, our student leaders work with young people in schools to develop their life skills, design and undertake social action projects. The programme is an ideal opportunity for University of Nottingham students to develop transferable leadership skills and gain real work experience in the education and sporting sector. Through sport and physical activity, you'll act as a mentor to the children helping them to build key life skills, develop and deliver their own social action projects. All volunteers receive extensive training, support from our Sports Volunteer Officer throughout the programme and Sport for Good kit (t-shirt and hoodie). To register your interest or to find out more about the programme, please complete this online form. You can also apply directly for the role through our Leadership Academy portal here. No, you don't need to be sporty! An interest in sport is helpful, but we're looking for volunteers passionate about working with young people and helping them to develop their skills. All sessions are based in primary and secondary schools around the Nottingham area. All travel expenses are covered for volunteers, along with any other costs you may incur. Yes, all volunteers will be required to complete a DBS check. Our team will help you with this process. +44 (0)115 748 7000 sport@nottingham.ac.uk Find our opening times here."
