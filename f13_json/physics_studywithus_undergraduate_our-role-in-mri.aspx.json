            "p": "The University of Nottingham has a unique 50-year legacy in the development of medical imaging. This rich history of novel development led to the award of a Nobel prize in 2003 to Professor Sir Peter Mansfield for his role in the development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI exploits the quantum mechanical properties of the protons in hydrogen atoms in water molecules in the body to generate images of soft tissues. From humble origins in a physics lab in the late 1970s, it became a world beating technology, and is now used for over 60 million clinical investigations worldwide every year. In this video, Nottingham physicist and MRI pioneer Professor Peter Morris CBE describes the origins of MRI, and Nottinghamâ€™s involvement in it.
