These changes might include: Applicants who have accepted offers should not be contacted until a closure/suspension recommendation has been accepted by Quality and Standards Committee (QSC). These applicants should then be informed of their options in regard to transferring their application to another course within the University or to another institution. Applicants who have been made offers, but have not yet accepted them, may however be contacted at an earlier stage to be informed that a closure/suspension recommendation has been made. Such applicants should be told that the offer of a place is suspended until a decision has been made and will be withdrawn if the recommendation is accepted. Where relevant, UCAS should be notified by informing the University UCAS correspondent when the closure/suspension recommendation has been accepted by QSC.
