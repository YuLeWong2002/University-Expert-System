            "p": "For Global Entrepreneurship Week 2024, we brought together two panels of alumni entrepreneurs to discuss how an entrepreneurial mindset can help drive innovation and creativity, generate fresh ideas and new ways of problem solving. Guiding the conversation was Dr Terri Holloway, Head of The Ingenuity Lab, Haydn Green Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Nottingham University Business School. In May, Jubilee Campus was host to the home leg of our global 25-year anniversary event series. The event brought together leading voices from the Business School community, each providing expert insights on AI, sustainability, and the future of business. Find out they had to say. We speak to Dan Warne (History, 2007) for his unique insight into establishing a business during a pandemic. The former Managing Director at Deliveroo left in late 2019 to establish his own start up in the hospitality sector. Sauce Shop co-founder James Digva (Food Science, 2007) shares his journey from market stall to supermarket aisle. Our alumni expert Jacky Francis Walker (Counselling Studies, 1999) shares the tell tale signs of burnout and provides techniques to prevent it happening at all."
