In addition, many employers desire candidates with a global or international outlook so language graduates have a lot to offer. Many language graduates really underestimate the value of their year abroad and therefore don't exploit it to its full potential when applying for jobs. If you would like to discuss how to make the most of your time abroad, get in touch. You need to decide whether you want a job where languages are central to the role.

Another way to immerse yourself in a foreign language is obviously to live in the target country - visit our working abroad pages. Many people start this process by teaching English abroad.
