            "p": "The welfare of animals used in biomedical research at the University of Nottingham is of paramount importance to all. The Unit Director is responsible to the Establishment Licence Holder for the day-to-day care of all animals held at the University of Nottingham research facilities. He is the senior Named Animal Care and Welfare Officer (NACWO). NACWOs ensure that the highest standards of husbandry and care are in place. Twenty-four hour veterinary support is provided by the Named Veterinary Surgeon (NVS) and a team of professional, qualified animal technicians monitor animal welfare in the facilities. Animal care follows the requirements of the Home Office Code of Practice for the Housing and Care of Animals used in Scientific Procedures. Environmental enrichment such as play tunnels or bedding material are widely used to keep animals both active and comfortable. All animals are checked frequently and at least once daily either by animal technicians, the NACWOs and/or the NVS to ensure that they are in good health. Animal technicians at the University of Nottingham are specialists in the care of animals. They are trained in correct animal handling, in husbandry and in the recognition of signs of pain, distress and disease. Animal technicians are encouraged to undertake professional qualifications awarded by the Institute of Animal Technology, and continued professional development (this includes attending research seminars, meetings and reading of relevant literature) to further their knowledge and skills. The University of Nottingham has procedures in place, including veterinary cover and a comprehensive call out system, to ensure that any welfare concern is dealt with as quickly as possible.
