            "p": "The collective was established to enable, develop, and support new research projects – functioning as both a think-tank and group. By taking this approach we aim to develop a multidisciplinary research culture which spans the arts and sciences which provides a platform to engage with the public and policy/lawmakers in a responsible way. A core part of our mission is to work with the University of Nottingham’s Researcher Academy to create opportunities and support the development of Research Staff (Researchers) at the University. By bringing people together from a range of research backgrounds we will develop an environment that encourages creativity and inclusivity and supports a range of knowledge-exchange activities. Our creative, sometimes experimental approaches and ways of thinking mean that we can be open, flexible, and responsive. STAHRC is cross-faculty and is hosted by the Researcher Academy at the University of Nottingham. Our membership reaches out to include people from across the globe, from multiple disciplines, including partners from Industry, the Arts and the Third Sector – it is open to all in the research ecosystem.
