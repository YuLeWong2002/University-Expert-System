            "p": "University Park Campus, Nottingham, UK Philosophy can be transformative. You can do it for its own sake as well as for its ability to shape lives, institutions, and society. You might be full of curiosity and wonder, anger and injustice, confusion or a desire to make sense of yourself and the world. Philosophy covers all these bases. And more. The first year introduces you to the essentials of ethics, reasoning and logic while also expanding your sense of what philosophy can do. You explore Western philosophies from ancient Greece onwards as well as world traditions. We’ll also teach you how to apply philosophy to contemporary issues. Mandatory Year 1 Mind, Knowledge, and Ethics Reasoning, Argument, and Logic Optional Metaphysics, Science, and Language Philosophy of Religions Philosophy and the Contemporary World History of Philosophy: Ancient to Modern Gender, Justice, and Society The above is a sample of the typical modules we offer, but is not intended to be construed or relied on as a definitive list of what might be available in any given year.
