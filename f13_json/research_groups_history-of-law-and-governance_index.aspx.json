The HLGC provides a focal point for leading interdisciplinary research into historical aspects of law and governance and a forum for discussion and collaboration between academics working in this area. We are committed to the promotion of interdisciplinary research, public engagement, and teaching excellence in the historical development of law, legal institutions and ideas of governance. Our members are involved in a range of research projects, with the HLGC providing a hub for inter-disciplinary research collaboration across the university. We host regular events throughout the year, including lectures, seminars, workshops, and reading groups. The centre is also concerned with promoting the history of law and governance through public engagement events. Our members conduct leading research in the fieldâ€”topics include research into the medieval origins of the English common law; the development of the law of easements following the early-modern Enclosure Acts; the New Poor Laws and the workhouse regime in the 19th century; and the development of international treaties, institutions and legal doctrine in the context of 20th century international relations, among others.
