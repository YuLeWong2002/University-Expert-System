            "p": "University Park Campus, Nottingham, UK Natural sciences allows you to study a combination of science subjects, getting to experience these at university before specialising later in the degree. You'll choose a combination of three subjects (called a stream) in your first year and study two subjects to degree level from your second year onwards. You can continue to study familiar subjects but can also study subjects you may not have studied before such as archaeology, cancer sciences, earth science, the environment or psychology. Our course offers the flexibility to focus on what you are interested in, develop a wide range of knowledge and skills and understand how scientific disciplines fit together. Find out more about the subjects you can study. The time in your first year is split equally studying three subjects. You will choose a subject stream (listed below) in early September following confirmation of your place. This choice is flexible and you can change stream any time up to the end of the first week of study providing you meet stream requirements. *Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics or Further Mathematics, Physics, Psychology, Geology, Geography and Environmental Science/Studies The majority of modules are compulsory but there are limited optional choices in a few subjects. For indicative modules on each stream, find out more about the subjects you can study. You'll study 120 credits a year, typically through 10, 20 or 40 credit modules. One credit equates to approximately 10 hours of work split between formal contact time, self-study, revision and assessment. The number of formal contact hours varies depending on the subjects you are studying but you will typically spend between 18 and 23 hours in your first year in the following classes: There are additional study group sessions which are optional but provide some structure to learning outside of formal classes and the remainder of your time is spent on independent study. Lectures vary in size from 30 to 400 students in the first year but tend to reduce in size in later years as students specialise more. Practical classes are between 20 and 50 students and may be done in pairs. Teaching is provided by academic staff within the relevant school. Additional support is provided in small group and practical classes from staff, PhD students and post-doctoral researchers. Studying for a degree at the University of Nottingham will provide you with the type of skills and experiences that will prove invaluable in any career, whichever direction you decide to take. Throughout your time with us, our Careers and Employability Service can work with you to improve your employability skills even further; assisting with job or course applications, searching for appropriate work experience placements and hosting events to bring you closer to a wide range of prospective employers. Have a look at our careers page for an overview of all the employability support and opportunities that we provide to current students. The University of Nottingham is consistently named as one of the most targeted universities by Britain’s leading graduate employers (Ranked in the top ten in The Graduate Market in 2013-2020, High Fliers Research). University Park Campus covers 300 acres, with green spaces, wildlife, period buildings and modern facilities. It is one of the UK's most beautiful and sustainable campuses, winning a national Green Flag award every year since 2003. I enjoyed the idea that I could just pick the sciences that I wanted to study as opposed to alternative natural sciences courses where you study all the sciences in first year and then differentiate.
