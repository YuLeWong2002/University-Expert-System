            "p": "The Government, through the Student Loans Company (SLC), is offering Postgraduate Doctoral Loans of up to Â£29,390 for eligible students who are studying a standalone taught or research Doctoral course that start between August 2024 and July 2025. For students who started their course between August 2018 and July 2024 the loan offered is less. The loan is a contribution towards the costs associated with completing a Doctoral degree and can be used towards tuition fees or living costs as you decide. The loan is non means tested and will be paid directly to you, the student, rather than the University. While providing a substantial contribution, the loan is very unlikely to be sufficient to cover both your tuition fees and livings costs. Therefore it is important that you source funding in addition to the loan, to ensure you can cover all costs before starting your course. The University has to confirm your registration to the SLC to release your Doctoral Loan. However, due to the data checking that is required by the SLC, this confirmation can take up to three weeks from when you are fully registered with us for your course and from the start date of your course/year. Payment will not be made until after the start date the SLC have recorded for your course/year. Where data provided by the SLC doesn't match what is in your University record, or the University identifies any other information affecting your eligiblity, registration will not be confirmed until these issues are resolved. Please note: If you move straight from an undergraduate course to a postgraduate course you must apply to the original awarding authority e.g. If Student Finance Wales funded your undergraduate course you must apply to them for postgraduate funding. If you are not eligible for the loan please ensure that before signing up for a course you investigate other funding available, for example through Research Councils, Studentships and charitable trusts."
