            "p": "The apparent collapse of the Maya culture in Yucatan peninsula of present-day Mexico, Guatemala and Belize around AD 1000 continues to puzzle and intrigue geoscientists and archaeologists. Was the abrupt cessation of major building projects in many places, and the apparent abandonment of some large cities, a result of politic conflict, reduced food production due to soil erosion, or drought? Working with colleagues at the Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan (Mexico), GFZ Potsdam (Germany), UCL and the British Geological Society (BGS), we are using a combination of lake monitoring and sediment core analysis to produce seasonally-resolved records of past climate change from lakes which produce laminated sediments. These sediments offer the chance to produce records of climate change with seasonal resolution, allowing the level of climatic stress suffered by past local populations to be assessed in a more nuanced way.
