However, these EHICs can no longer be used in Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein. EHICs will be replaced by a free UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC). This card covers some medical care but is not a replacement for travel insurance. EU students who start a course in the UK during the 2020-21 academic year are eligible for UK home student fees and financial support, in the form of the tuition fee loan in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Nothing will change for them throughout their degree. EU students not covered by the Withdrawal Agreement who start a course in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales during the 2021-22 academic year, and the following years, will no longer be eligible for home fee status and tuition fee loans. EU nationals with settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme, and who meet the relevant eligibility requirements in force at the time of course commencing, will have access to home fee status and student financial support in the 2021-22 academic year. For those subject to international fees, the amount will depend on the university and the type of degree and will vary between institutions. We advise EU students to reach out to the universities they are interested in with specific questions on international fee levels for the degree they have in mind.
