            "p": "Our research focuses on understanding how our eyes and brain provide us with information about the world that we can use to recognize and interact with objects, environments and people. We are interested in visual perception from the most basic level (e.g., how we discriminate different shades of colour) to the most complex (e.g., face and object recognition). To provide this understanding, we use techniques, such as eye-tracking (which allows us to track where participants are looking), EEG-ERP (to measure participantsâ€™ brain activity while viewing certain stimuli, such as faces and other objects), and classical behavioral (e.g., remembering faces) and psychophysical paradigms. Visual illusions in Malaysia: do different cultural groups see visual illusions to different extents? Over the years, group members have received funding from the following sources: A Pump-Priming grant from the Faculty of Science at the University of Nottingham - Malaysia Campus, a Fundamental Research Grant (FRGS) from the Malaysian Ministry of Higher Education (MOE), a ScienceFund grant from the Malaysian Ministry of Science, Technology and Inovation (MOSTI), and grants from the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council (UK), the Royal Society (UK), and the British Council. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8018"
