            "p": "Following an invitation from the Ministry of education to establish an overseas campus, a partnership between Boustead Holdings Berhad, YTL Corporation Berhad and the University of Nottingham was formally announced in 1998. This development was a fundamental part of Nottingham's vision to become a truly global university for the 21st century and beyond. It was the first ever branch campus of a British University established outside of the UK and this innovative concept earned the University the prestigious Queen’s Award for Enterprise in the field of international achievement – the first time such an award had been bestowed on an academic institution. The University of Nottingham welcomed its first students in September 2000. In 2015, UNMC celebrates its 15th year anniversary. The Malaysia Campus is an integral part of The University of Nottingham, UK and offers students the Nottingham experience in a setting that's truly Asia. It is part of a global institution serving an international community of students, yet firmly rooted in all that is distinctive about UK education - innovative teaching and assessment methods, which encourage independent, creative thinking. The student profile at the University also reflects Nottingham's status as a global university, with more than 1,400 international students to further enrich on-campus diversity.
