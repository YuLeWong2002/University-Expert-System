            "p": "For any questions about the public science lectures, please contact Hilary Collins or the Institute for Policy and Engagement. Perhaps surprisingly, researchers have found that people will frequently identify how aspects of their identity, relationships, and worldviews have changed in positive ways after experiencing an adverse or difficult event in their lives. These positive changes, often referred to by researchers as post-traumatic growth, can involve a greater appreciation of life, greater clarity on priorities in life, or greater investment in the relationships that matter most to the person. In this talk, Dr Laura Blackie will discuss the extent to which the scientific evidence supports that individuals' perceptions of post-traumatic growth are aligned with reality, and the challenges in studying this phenomena with the scientific method.
