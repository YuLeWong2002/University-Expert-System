            "p": "The Library and the Learning Spaces in UNM strive to maintain a welcoming, comfortable, and safe environment for all users. Users are expected to maintain behaviour that consistently respects the rights of other users to study, conduct research and engage in collaborative work within the Library and Learning Spaces. Any behaviour or condition that disrupts the orderly use of the Library/Learning Spaces, that could constitute harassment, or that affects the staffâ€™s ability to provide service, is prohibited and will be handled by the appropriate enforcement authority in the University. Examples of Disruptive Behaviour include the following: All users are expected to abide and comply with these policies when using the Library and Learning Spaces. Library staff members, authorised student advisers and security personnel managing the facilities are empowered with the responsibility to approach disruptive groups and individuals and ask them to discontinue disruptive behaviour. Non-compliance: in the first instance of users who fail to comply with the rules when requested, an email will be sent out advising the user(s) to abide with the rules and regulations. If the user continues to be disruptive, a written warning letter will be sent to the user, copied to the relevant Head of School and the Vice-Provost for Teaching & Learning (who is also Head of the Disciplinary Board) with a view to enforcing disciplinary action when deemed necessary. Please see our contact page for telephone and email contact points."
