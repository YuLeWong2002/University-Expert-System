            "p": "The Face Perception Group investigates the way in which the appearance of people’s faces and bodies influence the way in which others view them. We use perceptual psychological techniques to examine the cues that people use to attribute things to faces like: We are also interested in how accurate people’s judgements are, using biological techniques to assess people’s actual health. We use questionnaires and psychological assessment techniques to assess how different people perceive faces. Another arm of our research concerns the way in which autistic and neurotypical individuals perceive the world. What are the similarities and differences between these groups? Do autistic and neurotypical individuals use different cues to assess attractiveness in faces? Do individuals from different cultures and ethnic groups use facial cues differently in assessing health or recognising faces? How does exercise affect the appearance of our faces and bodies? How does parenting style affect adolescents' perception of threat in faces? telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8018"
