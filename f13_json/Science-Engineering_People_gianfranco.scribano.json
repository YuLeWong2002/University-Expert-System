            "p": "Associate Professor, Dr. Gianfranco Scribano is an Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the Department of Mechanical, Materials and Manufacturing Engineering, University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus. Dr. Scribano obtained his M.Sc. in Aerospace Engineering in 1999 and then he received his Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering in 2004 both at Politecnico di Milano, Italy. After the Ph.D. he has worked in private industries for 8 years in the R&D to develop combustion and energy systems with experimental and simulation tools. Beside the publication in international journals and conferences, he is also an inventor of 6 patent applications for combustion devices and aerosol generators. Dr. Scribano's expertise is on combustion emission reduction and fluid-mechanics. He uses experimental techniques such as PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry), PDI (Phase Doppler Interferometry) in both reactive and non-reactive flows. He also has extensive relevant experience in conducting CFD to design combustion system and test-rig. During his industrial working career, he has acquired hands-on experience in project management and new product development from concept analysis to production.
