            "p": "Biogeochemistry is concerned primarily with unravelling and understanding chemical cycling in the environment. The main focus is on potentially hazardous trace elements (e.g.. Pb, Cd, As) and radionuclides (14C, 137Cs, 129I, 238U, 232Th) but also includes broader consideration of carbon and nitrogen dynamics and availability of micronutrients (Se, I, Zn) in soils and aquatic systems. Much of our work involves measurement and modelling of elemental and isotopic cycling and we combine data and modelling expertise in risk assessment applications. We have in-house expertise in multi element and ultra-low level trace element analysis using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), which is coupled with High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) to identify inorganic or organic species of elements or isotopes. This capability is augmented by collaboration with specialist laboratories at the British Geological Survey. GeoNutrition (Bailey, Lark, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation).
