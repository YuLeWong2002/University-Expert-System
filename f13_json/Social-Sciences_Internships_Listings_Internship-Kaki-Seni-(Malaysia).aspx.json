We are convinced more people should have access to the performing arts and we are certain that when people get together to have the same conversation, it makes for an enriching experience. Kakiseni is committed to make this happen really often - through grants; talent development programmes for artists; event listings; easy ticketing machine (our partners Senedi kindly helped create it); and of course, the great personalised relationship we have with you. Simply put, at Kakiseni, we envision a future of you, your friends, their friends and just about everyone else; spreading the goodness of arts. Start your career in performing arts with a programme that prepares you by putting you to work in the industry! The Apprentice Programme is targeted at people who would like to work in the performing arts industry but donâ€™t know where to start. Successful applicants are apprenticed at Malaysian performing arts companies where they are encouraged to learn tricks of the trade through practical work and experiential learning. To help them along, apprentices will also receive an allowance of RM1,800 per month to compensate their living expenses for the duration of the programme.
