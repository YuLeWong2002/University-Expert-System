            "p": "Molecules are the defining building blocks that underpin economic activity and modern living standards. We are all reliant upon the secure and affordable supply of clean water, nutritious food, medicines, fabrics and much more. Yet many of the materials that make these goods are manufactured inefficiently, unsustainably and unimaginatively. We believe the next global industrial revolution will be driven by a step change in the creation of these materials. We will drive the realisation of sustainable supply chains, considering all stages from atoms-to-products. We will pioneer research with a multi-disciplinary approach, integrating our world-leading expertise in metabolic engineering, process development and sustainable chemistry to address UN Sustainable Development Goals, including Climate Action and Sustainable Industrialisation, and answer these critical questions: \"Eight million tonnes of plastic ends up in our oceans each year. It can take anything from 10 years to 450 years to decompose, with lethal consequences for marine life and ultimately human life.\" - Sir David Attenborough, BBC Blue Planet II"
