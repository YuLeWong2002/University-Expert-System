            "p": "The Faculty of Social Sciences is one of the largest and most diverse in Europe. Our community is made up of students and staff from more than 150 countries and, combined with our three campuses in the UK, China and Malaysia, this offers you the opportunity to study at a truly global university. Many of our faculty schools are consistently ranked among the best in the country. See how the story of Social Sciences at Nottingham unfolded. Social sciences at Nottingham have a long history dating back to 1798, and since then they have grown in depth and breadth to include a wide range of subject areas and academic disciplines. Social science covers a broad and exciting field of study. Contemporary social sciences have their roots in ancient history, when at that time there was little distinction between science, mathematics and the study of history, poetry, philosophy or politics. Today, social sciences are the fields of scientific knowledge and academic scholarship concerned with the study of the social, economic and business life and activities of human groups, individuals and society. The faculty offers a range of undergraduate and postgraduate courses, and is home to an ESRC Doctoral Training Centre and Doctoral Training Programme as part of the Midlands Graduate School Consortium. Whether its business, law, economics, politics, sociology, geography, or education, the Faculty of Social Sciences brings the world to you and has something to offer everyone. Project by project and person by person, we are working hard to make the world a better place for everyone.
