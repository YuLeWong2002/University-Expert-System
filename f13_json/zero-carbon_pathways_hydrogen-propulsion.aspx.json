            "p": "The University of Nottingham has one of the largest research groups for low carbon propulsion globally with a hydrogen-related funding portfolio exceeding £50m. We are the lead university for the Sustainable Hydrogen Centre for Doctoral Training, with 67 fully funded 4-year PhD studentships. We carry out research on hydrogen storage and production, and combustion and emissions from decarbonised fuels, with more than 45 partners and over £35m in research funding. We are investing in new equipment that will enable the Zero Carbon Cluster to create a leading position in the UK for advanced testing of integrated hydrogen power systems across multiple heavy transport sectors. This new equipment, together with existing university rigs, will deliver the ability to run full systems testing with hydrogen and other green fuels. It will provide the advanced thermal management and super-cooling necessary for achieving high efficiency and performance and demonstrating the safety needed for certification to commercialise new systems.
