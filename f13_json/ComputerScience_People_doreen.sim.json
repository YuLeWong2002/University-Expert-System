            "p": "Assistant Professor, Dr. Sim acquired her PhD degree (Doctor of Philosophy) in Data Mining, Machine Learning and Computational Intelligence after acquiring her M.Sc. degree in Business Information Technology from University of Portsmouth, United Kingdom and B.Sc.(Honors) degree in Business Information Technology from University of Central England in Birmingham, United Kingdom. Dr. Sim also acquired double major degrees in Medical Sciences, ie. in Pharmacology and Physiology, from University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand. Dr. Sim has around 23 years of lecturing and research experiences in the tertiary education industry, i.e. in both public and private universities. For research publications, Dr. Sim has done a lot of researches in using Machine Learning techniques to develop prediction and early detection algorithms in the medical field such as in Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Human-Computer Interaction, Computational Intelligence, Human-Robot Interaction and Robotics, i.e. part of Artificial Intelligence. My main research interests embark in Data Mining, Machine Learning and Computational Intelligence. Currently, I am doing a lot of researches in EEG, ECG, EOG and EMG as well as in developing prediction and early detection algorithms for medical diagnoses such as for Obstructive Sleep Apnea. Dr Sim has more than 21 years of professional lecturing experience in IT and Computer Science in the tertiary education industry, i.e. mainly in public and private universities. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8018"
