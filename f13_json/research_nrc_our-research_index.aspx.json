            "p": "To support the NRC research strategy the University is developing a programme of research covering all aspects of rehabilitation from prevention and rehabilitation, through to living with long-term conditions. Using translational, multi-disciplinary approaches to research the NRC aims to deliver transformative patient care and to integrate data into personalised, holistic rehabilitation services. To achieve this, we have formed a uniquely broad community of researchers that expand far beyond clinical and applied health professions into areas such as linguistic, biomedical engineering, computer science, mathematical modelling, human physiology, state-of-the-art imaging, social policy and organisational leadership. Dr Claudia Danielmeier, Associate Professor Psychology: How can we predict which treatments will benefit individual patients. Claudia’s research focuses cognitive control and performance monitoring processes in healthy individuals as well as in people with mental health or neurological disorders. Dr Laura Blackie. Associate Professor School of Psychology : How do people find meaning from challenging life events. Laura’s research is focused on post-traumatic growth and examines the extent to which people perceive they have changed positively after adversity, and the extent to which researchers can actually measure this over time. Professor Paul Greenhaff, The David Greenfield Human Physiology Unit, University of Nottingham: Do physical activity levels affect our body as we age?BBSRC (UKRI) project: Concurrent multi-organ responses to chronic physical activity and inactivity intervention to increase research discovery in human health and wellbeing.
