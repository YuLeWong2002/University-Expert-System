            "p": "University Park Campus, Nottingham, UK This is the course for true language lovers, giving you the opportunity to study three languages. If your passion is being able to communicate with people from around the globe, and you dream of having the opportunity to immerse yourself in other cultures – then this is course is for you! During your time with us, we’ll guide you through your three chosen languages (one of which may be from beginners' level) helping you push yourself towards fluency in preparation for your year abroad. Many of our students say the year abroad is their course highlight.

Taking yourself out of your comfort zone won’t only benefit your degree, it’ll shape the person you are to become.

As a guide 20 credits (a typical module) is approximately 200 hours of work (combined teaching and self-study). An average week will have between 14 and 20 hours of classes.

The University of Nottingham is consistently named as one of the most targeted universities by Britain’s leading graduate employers.* *Ranked in the top ten in The Graduate Market in 2013-2020, High Fliers Research. University Park Campus covers 300 acres, with green spaces, wildlife, period buildings and modern facilities. It is one of the UK's most beautiful and sustainable campuses, winning a national Green Flag award every year since 2003. I think the workload of learning three languages can be challenging. However, it is only like taking 6 different other modules on a different course. Personally, I find the more languages you learn, the more you understand each one separately as well as their own.
