            "p": "Your relationship with the University of Nottingham doesn't end when you graduate. We have many ways for our alumni to get involved and keep in touch, and help to inspire students currently studying with us. As a graduate of the University of Nottingham, you can continue to use the Careers and Employability Service to help build your career. They provide guidance and advice, run events, and have a job vacancy service. Giving your time is a great way to learn new skills, get more involved in the University and meet alumni. We offer a range of roles that you can do from home, work, in the UK or from anywhere in the world. Whether you can offer 30 minutes or 30 hours, your time will make a positive difference. Our mentoring schemes offer Nottingham alumni the opportunity to provide meaningful career support to current students and fellow alumni. Mentoring develops via remote contact over the academic year, giving participants time to benefit from their mentor's professional experience and knowledge. Donations from the university's community of alumni, students, parents and staff have created the fund Cascade, to support transformative student projects. Judged by a panel of leading alumni donors, Cascade awards funds to projects that will enrich the lives of our students and people across the world. The university alumni website provides many ways to keep in touch and stay connected and lists of the latest alumni events."
