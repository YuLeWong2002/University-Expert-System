Our current featured Lab members are GOAB Bio Engineers, set up by Ebenezer Berko Owusu and Philemon Gyasi-Antwi. Ebenezer, an Advanced Materials graduate, and Philemon, a Microbiology and Immunology PhD graduate, have used their bioengineering ingenuity to develop an innovative way of reducing plastic waste, through the production of recycled composite boards. Inspired by seeing the damaging effects of plastic waste on their home country of Ghana, they decided to start making a difference themselves. While they are still in the early stages of their entrepreneurial journey, they have already achieved recognition for their innovation this year, winning awards at the 2021 Ingenuity Impact Evening, and the Engineers in Business Champion of Champions National Final. The Ingenuity Lab Ambassador Scheme is for those whose business has developed beyond the start-up stage, and who can inspire and mentor our next generation of Venture members. Hear more about some of their start-up journeys below. Jubilee Campus Nottingham NG8 1BB Email: ingenuitylab@nottingham.ac.uk"
