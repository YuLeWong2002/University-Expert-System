            "p": "Assistant Professor, Maxine Yee is a materials engineer/scientist with research interest in nanoscience technology and advanced materials. She completed her B. Eng (Materials) and M. Tech (Materials Science) from University of Malaya (UM), and PhD (Advanced Materials) in 2018 from University of Nottingham Malaysia. Her passion for engineering education was fostered from working with young adults since 2004 in both the public and private higher education and public sectors in Malaysia and the United States. Dr. Yee's research is focused in the area of advanced materials and nanoscience technology with applications towards coatings with effective antifouling and anticorrosion properties. Her research interest also includes advancing the use of nanotechnology for biomedical applications. She is also collaborating with industrial partners in materials failure analysis investigations.
