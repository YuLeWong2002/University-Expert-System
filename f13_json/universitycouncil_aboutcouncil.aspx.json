As a body of high profile and influential individuals, Council members effectively represent the University in the local community, amongst staff and students, and through international networks and representative bodies. The formal business of Council takes place through five meetings every year, and through working groups specialising in specific areas of the University business. Informally, however, Council members may also choose to represent the University at key events such as awards and graduation ceremonies, openings and launches, and key community events.
