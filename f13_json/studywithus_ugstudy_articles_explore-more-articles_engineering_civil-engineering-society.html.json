            "p": "Read about how our civil engineering students spend their free time It’s no secret that university is a social affair, and what better way to socialise than by joining a society! CivSoc is run by civil engineering students and is the perfect way to socialise with your course mates, meet students from different years and have fun. With advice from older students and welfare support offered, it really will feel like your extended family. Events include pizza socials, balls, and an annual boat party, to sports teams – including football, netball and rugby – which compete against other UoN societies. With so much going on you’ll never be bored and will make friends for life. Follow us on Facebook. Learn all about our engineering and architecture societies. 3rd year student Petru tells us about the opportunities available outside of studies. Watch Petru, as he talks about his favourite societies. He’ll give you the lowdown on all the types of societies and the best ways to spend your spare time whilst studying with us."
