SafePods are designed to provide accredited researchers with access to secure datasets from participating Data Centres across the UK. Access to secure datasets usually involves regular long-distance travel, however, the ESRC aims to open up opportunities for research by providing local access within a safe setting. A SafePod has many features including a door control access system, CCTV, a researcher area for the analysis of datasets, a secure service area, wheelchair accessibility and height-adjustable desk. The SafePod at Nottingham is one of the first to be installed nationally and opened for bookings in August 2021. By late 2023, a total of 23 SafePods are expected to be part of the SafePod Network. Datasets are available from the following data centres: Researchers can browse the ADR UK Data Catalogue, a tool for exploring the growing collection of administrative datasets available from ADR UK partners. Users can filter the metadata in the catalogue by ADR organisation, theme, or spatial coverage. For more information about the SafePod at the University of Nottingham, please email library-researchsupport@nottingham.ac.uk. We advise that if you are starting a project and using the UoN SafePod for the first time, you get in touch to discuss your planned timeframe with us.
