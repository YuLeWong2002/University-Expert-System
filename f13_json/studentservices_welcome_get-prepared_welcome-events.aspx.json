We host Welcome Villages across our campuses all week, to give everyone the chance to socialise and meet fellow students. The Welcome Villages host a range of fun, informative and social activities throughout your first week, including events in the evenings and at the weekend. There are Welcome Villages on University Park, Sutton Bonington and Jubilee Campuses. There are loads of societies to get involved with at university. From skydiving to knitting and Quidditch, there's something for everyone.
