            "p": "Additive biofabrication is the use of three-dimensional (3-D) printing technologies to create structures that can direct the behaviour of biological systems. Our cluster supports and brings together researchers who are using topographical features and chemistry to influence and modulate both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell behaviour, or are interested in recreating in vivo biological structures and cellular communities in vitro, and those who are exploiting 'artificialâ€™ structures that can be used as novel biotechnologies. Additive Biofabrication has the potential for establishing a design-led manufacturing approach to the production of in vitro models for drug discovery and development, for cell based clinical therapies and for biotechnology applications.
