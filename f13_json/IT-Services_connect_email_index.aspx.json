            "p": "Official communications to staff and students are sent to University email accounts. The format of University email addresses is: Log in to Outlook Web Access: Staff should primarily access their email account from a Windows-based computer using Microsoft Outlook but can also use Outlook Web Access via a web browser. Should you wish to configure other devices (iPhone, iPad, Android, etc.) to connect to your email account, please use the following settings: A detailed guide on how to connect Outlook to Office365 is available at the Microsoft support page. As a large institution the University is targeted by malicious emails. If you are unsure about an email, please read our guidance on how to spot phishing emails. Office365 has a built in anti-spam protection service which scans incoming emails for spam, phishing and viruses before being delivered to your mailbox. A detailed guide on how to use this service is available at the Microsoft support page. Users sending University communications via email must use their University account. Personal email accounts must not be used for conducting University business or communications. All Univeristy email users are bound by our Code of Practice. Failure to adhere could result in disciplinary procedures. telephone: +603 8924 8199 fax: +603 8924 8007 email: itservicedesk@nottingham.edu.my"
