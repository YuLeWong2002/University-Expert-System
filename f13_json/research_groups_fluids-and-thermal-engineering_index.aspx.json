            "p": "Research undertaken by the group has impacted on a widerange of industrial applications including flow assurance and control, conventional and new energy cars, refrigerationand air-conditioning, and industrial chemical processes. Working closely with industrial partners, FLUTE is focussed on developing solutions to challenging problems as well as developing greater understanding of the fluid flow phenomena. FLUTE continues to conduct nationally and internationally recognised research while training excellent researchers in fluids and thermal engineering.
