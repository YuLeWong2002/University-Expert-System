            "p": "In January's Take 5 we have a frozen Highfields Lake, a new theory of evolution, the first in-person event of 2024, news about our half-term swim school at the David Ross Sports Village and tributes are paid to a dedicated university professor who passed away last month. Also, see if you can work out our mystery location on campus, taken in just the two photos. It's been quite the month of weather across the UK and especially in Nottinghamshire. In the first half of January intense rainful meant much of the county was subject to flooding, with the River Trent reaching levels not seen for almost a quarter of a century. Then Winter truly arrived in Nottingham just a week or so later, with temperatures well into the minus figures. It did lead to some beautiful scenery on campus, however, including a frozen Highfields Lake, captured expertly by your alumni team! Do you remember any particularly snowy winters when you were at Nottingham? Why not send us your photos? Tributes have poured in for Professor Brian Tuck, who worked at the University of Nottingham for over 30 years. He died at the age of 83 on Sunday 17 December last year. Professor Tuck joined the university in 1968, and went on to become head of department in 1988. He held the role for ten years before moving to Malaysia to establish the universityâ€™s first international campus, where he also headed a department until his retirement.

Around 100 guests joined us at the reception, which was held as we develop new and exciting projects with partners in Chile, such as the newly launched Clean Energy Project. What next? We have events across Africa in coming weeks, including in Lagos, Cape Town, Nairobi and Johannesburg. Check out our upcoming events > A groundbreaking university study has found that evolution is not as unpredictable as previously thought, which could allow scientists to explore which genes could be useful to tackle real-world issues such as antibiotic resistance, disease and climate change. The study, which is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), challenges the long-standing belief about the unpredictability of evolution, and has found that the evolutionary trajectory of a genome may be influenced by its evolutionary history, rather than determined by numerous factors and historical accidents.
