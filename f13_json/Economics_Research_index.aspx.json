The school is also the established home of the Decision Maker Panel and the Centre for Globalisation and Economic Policy. As a top-ranking international research department, our research projects have attracted millions of pounds in awards and grants, featured hundreds of times in leading academic journals and earned thousands of citations. We have collaborated with experts in fields as diverse as psychology, political science, and anthropology. Our research-active staff provide strong support for early career researchers. We strive for our research to make an impact beyond academia – helping boost economic competitiveness, improve the effectiveness of public services and policy, and enhance quality of life. We have made important contributions in all these areas through the work of our research centres and have produced a series of videos illustrating how some of our research can be understood in the real world. Information related to Research Ethics, including access to the research ethics approval form, is available on SharePoint. Eight major research centres are hosted within the school covering the full range of economic theory and applied economics and econometrics. We runs a series of seminars and workshops, some general and some of which relate to the more specialist interests of the school's research centres.
