The Act of Remembrance unites people of all faiths, cultures, and backgrounds with members of our university community invited to pause and reflect in their own way. The names of staff and students who lost their lives during the First World War are recorded on a memorial plaque in the Trent Building foyer and union flags will be flown. You can find out more about the roles played by the university, its staff and students in our World War I centenary webpages published in 2018 to mark the 100th anniversary of the end of the conflict.
