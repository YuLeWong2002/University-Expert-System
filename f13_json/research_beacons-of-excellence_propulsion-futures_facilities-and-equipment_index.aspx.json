            "p": "The use of fossil fuels in global transportation systems is unsustainable, unviable and effectively driving the destruction of our planet. So, it’s crucial to make significant in-roads into the development of greener, safer solutions. This is why we have invested £13 million in world-class facilities and equipment. By developing capabilities in human and infrastructure resources not available elsewhere in academia and industry, we aim to lower the barriers to the application of technologies – and make breakthrough discoveries that will facilitate greener propulsion.
