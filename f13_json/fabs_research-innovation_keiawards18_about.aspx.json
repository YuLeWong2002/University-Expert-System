The awards will raise awareness of the exceptional work across the University and celebrate Knowledge Exchange projects on the pathway to success as well as those projects which are more advanced. Showcase your success by entering, or nominate a deserving colleague (you can nominate others in the media, policy impact and VC’s award categories only). The awards provide an exciting opportunity to celebrate your achievements with your colleagues and learn more about the fantastic impact across the University.
