In the USA, graduate degrees, known as master's degrees, are offered by about 1,000 colleges in various fields. These degrees typically take two to three years to complete, though some one-year options exist. There are two main types: Common types of master's degrees include M.A. (Masters of Arts) and M.S. (Masters of Science), involving self-directed study leading to a thesis submission. Unlike the UK, pure research programs are not common, instead, a blend of taught and research components is typical, with more frequent assessments. Admission to American master's programmes follow a process similar to the UK, requiring at least a 2:2 undergraduate degree from a recognised institution. However, conversion rates between UK and US grading systems vary by institution. To study in the USA, foreign nationals need an F-1 non-immigrant visa, requiring acceptance into a course and registration with Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS).

Graduate programme fees vary widely by subject and institution, with financial aid available. Students, including international ones, can receive some form of financial aid, such as needs-based assistance, merit scholarships, or sports scholarships.
