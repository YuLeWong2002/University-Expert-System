            "p": "The University offers a comprehensive Cycle to Work scheme accessible through the Employee Hub. Operated on a salary sacrifice basis, the scheme allows employees to hire a bike and equipment from the University for twelve months and has increased the value of the scheme to enable staff to purchase bicycles up to the value of Â£4,000. After this period the employee may, at the University's and scheme provider's discretion, be offered options to extend the hire agreement or take ownership of the bike.
