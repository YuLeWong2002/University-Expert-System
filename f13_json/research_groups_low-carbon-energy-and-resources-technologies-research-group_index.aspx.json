            "p": "The vision of the Low Carbon Energy and Technologies (LCERT) Research Group is to: The vision maps directly onto the drive for decarbonisation across the power, heat and industry sectors, much of this being articulated through the UK government’s Industrial Strategy and Clean Growth Strategy. This will be achieved by building upon our current grant portfolio including Centres for Doctoral Training and a number of EPSRC, EU and Industry-funded projects. The group will continue to act as hub within the faculty and the University for Innovative Researchon conventional power generation, CO2 captureand utilisation, biomass thermochemical conversiontechnologies, sustainable production of low carbon fuels and chemicals from biomass andwaste, and low carbon heating technologies.
