            "p": "Complementing our existing BSc (Hons) Economics degree, NSE Malaysia has launched a new BSc (Hons) Economics and International Economics degree in the 2015-2016 academic year. The new BSc (Hons) Economics and International Economics degree allows students to specialise in various aspects of international economics, with strong emphasis on both international trade and international finance. It is worthwhile to note that the specialisation on international economics does not dilute in anyway the core economics grounding, as the BSc (Hons) Economics and International Economics degree retains all the core compulsory modules of the existing BSc (Hons) Economics degree, but augments it with 5 additional core compulsory modules in international economics: The BSc (Hons) Economics and International Economics degree is ideal for students who would like to obtain a solid understanding of international economics in this increasingly globalised world. The BSc (Hons) Economics, on the other hand, is ideal for students who would like to have more flexibility in choosing economics modules, as they can opt to choose selected modules from the 8 modules listed above along with other economics modules as their electives. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8253 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8019"
