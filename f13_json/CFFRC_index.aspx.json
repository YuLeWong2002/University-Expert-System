Since its inception, CFF has established partnerships with organisations around the world to improve food and nutrition security, health and incomes of the poor, and the sustainable management of fragile ecosystems. Crops For the Future Research Centre (CFFRC) was established in 2011 to provide research support for the global Crops For the Future organisation. CFFRC is a company limited by guarantee and without share capital. Its guarantors are the Government of Malaysia and the University of Nottingham in Malaysia. In 2014, Crops For the Future and CFFRC combined their resources to form a single global entity - Crops For the Future (CFF). CFF now combines its research and development functions on underutilised crops (CFF Research) with FutureCrop, an educational resource for underutilised crops and agricultural biodiversity.
