            "p": "Recruiting the right people in the right way is clearly important. These pages seek to guide you through the decisions and the steps involved, including how best to induct each new recruit so that they can \"hit the ground running\". This section provides you with a clear, step-by-step guide to recruiting the best staff in your area. It covers all the stages of recruitment; from approval to fill a post, grading a post, advertising, interviewing (including giving feedback) to your legal obligations. The Building a Culture for Success recruitment framework details how you can measure the behaviours of an individual throughout the hiring process, from application, to interview, and then throughout their time working at the University. Here, we offer advice, guidance and resources in order for hiring managers to ensure they are embedding this throughout the recruitment process. This SharePoint site gives practical advice on areas such as use of University systems and useful contacts, it also provides a useful point to introduce new staff to the training and development opportunities that are available to them."
