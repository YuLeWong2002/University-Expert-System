The rest of the programme will then be completed at the Malaysia Campus.

A PhD in Economics will give you invaluable skills and excellent career credentials. You could apply your economic skills and knowledge in roles such as researchers, academics, economists, and economic consultants. These roles often value many skills acquired and developed from a postgraduate qualification. In broader contexts, other options related to economics include, among others, financial risk analysts, investment analysts, and quantitative analysts. You could work in banks, hedge funds and investment banks that use models and analyses to assess financial risks. Besides, some management consultancies and larger financial firms also employ specific economic consultants for helping organisations to solve problems and improve business performance.
