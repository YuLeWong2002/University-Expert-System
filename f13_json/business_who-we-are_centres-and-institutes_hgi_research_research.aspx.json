            "p": "Globally, it is recognised that creativity, innovation, risk, knowledge transfer and technology transfer are key to competitiveness. The Haydn Green Instituteâ€™s study of innovation and entrepreneurship includes research into these activities and behaviours, and provides Nottingham University Business School and the wider University with the research capability to better understand these issues. Research undertaken at the Institute broadly falls under three main categories. Advancing our international work in entrepreneurship education, HGI researchers are engaged in developing research insights on effective entrepreneurship education in a range of contexts. We are engaged in studying and stimulating innovation at grass roots community levels as well as collaborating with ventures applying innovation to address real-world problems. HGI researchers are active in broadening perceptions and models of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurs. Our work is committed to recognising as legitimate, entrepreneurial actions and actors beyond mainstream stereotypes and the variety of ways that these contribute to society.
