Members of CSCC conduct research at the crossroads of media and culture, communication technology, and social change. The emerging digital and globalised world provides a focus for research, which considers a variety of media and cultural forms, ranging from the printed to the digital, from popular to high arts, from multinational to local producers, and from mainstream to alternative media and cultures. The Centre offers a taught postgraduate MA Media, Communications and Culture and also runs a PhD programme. The Centre is linked to undergraduate programmes such as the BA (Hons) International Communications Studies and the BA (Hons) International Relations. Together with the core activities of research, teaching and publishing, the Centre organises lectures, seminars and events that are of interest to researchers, professionals and students.
