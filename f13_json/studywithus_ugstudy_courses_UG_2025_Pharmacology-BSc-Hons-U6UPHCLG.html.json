This includes any type of chemical or biological agent that produces an effect on the body including medicines, drugs of abuse, poisons, and chemicals in the food we eat and drink. There are two aspects to pharmacology: the effect of the drug on the body, and the effect of the body on the drug. In this course we aim to answer some of the biggest questions we have surrounding drugs and medicine today and for the future. In year one, you will study a number of core modules covering physiology, biochemistry, neuroscience and medicinal chemistry. In the second year, you will start to focus on the pharmacology of current drugs and drug targets, and in the third year you will learn about the recent advances in pharmacology, and the application of pharmacology in the drug discovery process.
