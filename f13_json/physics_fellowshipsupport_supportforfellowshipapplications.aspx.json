            "p": "We welcome applications for personal Fellowships including: Nottingham Research and Anne McLaren Fellowships Please contact the Head of School if you are considering applying for one of these. If you don't see the one you'd like to apply for listed above, then please get in touch for further advice. Potential applicants are also advised to contact the proposed host research group as soon as possible. Please let us know that you intend to apply well in advance (at least 6 weeks) of the funder deadline. Please include in your email a CV and an outline of your proposal, and let us know what your proposed research would cost (especially if you need access to specific equipment or facilities). Many fellowship applications need letters of support from the Head of School and/or institutional support. These can usually only be requested once the application is almost complete and it is in your interest to allow sufficient time for this additional support to be secured.
