These funds are essential in helping the University to: Our global alumni community is 300,000 Nottingham graduates strong, spanning 195 different countries. We bring this community together, through our alumni proposition `Connected we thrive', by providing relevant, beneficial and engaging activities and communications through which our alumni can gain professional skills and insights or find personal motivation and inspiration. We continue to fuel the learning of our alumni, helping them to grow who and what they know. Through this activity we build a pool of engaged alumni, willing to advocate for the University, give their time to benefit students, staff or other alumni, or donate financially to support the student experience or world changing research, either now or in the future. For further information please see the CARO SharePoint (University of Nottingham staff only)."
