            "p": "Each team and individual competitor plays to win their league or competition, but crucially also for BUCS points. These points feed into an overall table where over 140 different HE institutions are ranked. The University of Nottingham is consistently a top performer - we haven't finished outside the top ten since the introduction of the leagues 40 years ago and in 2018-19 we finished 2nd, and before the 2019-20 season was curtailed by Coronavirus, we led the rankings. With over 20 of those teams playing in the top division of their sport and several students tipped for individual gold this season, BUCS offers a fantastic opportunity for spectators to watch top quality sport right on their doorstep.
