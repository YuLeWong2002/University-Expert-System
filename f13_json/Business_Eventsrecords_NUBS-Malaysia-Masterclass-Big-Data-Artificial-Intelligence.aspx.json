Please RSVP before 14 April 2019 with Dr Angelina Yee (Director, Executive Education) at Angelina.Yee@nottingham.edu.my In the recent past, the fields of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) have attracted a lot of attention from both academia and industry. Together, they have started to change our business landscape and provide more opportunities for companies to implement innovative business models. Companies such as Alibaba, Google and Facebook have invested heavily on incorporating AI and big data within their business models to create, deliver and capture value. This inaugural masterclass in the NUBS Malaysia Masterclass Series provides an overview of the applications of big data and AI in business together with the sharing of recent research in the area by academicians at the University of Nottingham, to demonstrate how businesses can take advantage of big data and AI in value creation. Professor Alain Chong was born in London but grew up in Malaysia and Indonesia. He was named as one of Ten Outstanding Young Malaysians by Junior Chamber International in 2012. Elsevier named him as one of the most cited scholars in China in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. Alain is also a Ningbo 3315 Foreign Talent Recipient. To date, he has received more than RMB 3 million in funding from the HK General Research Fund, Chinaâ€™s National Natural Science Foundation (NSFC), and the Royal Society (UK). He has published more than 100 articles in journals and conference proceedings. He was also named one of the Top 50 Most Productive Malaysian Computer Science Researchers between 2000-2010 by Web of Science.
