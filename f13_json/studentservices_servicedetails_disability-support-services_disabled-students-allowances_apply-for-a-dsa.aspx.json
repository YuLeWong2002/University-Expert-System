            "p": "Additional funding for assistive technology and one-to-one support We recommend you apply for the Disabled Students' Allowances (DSA) before you start your course or within the first few months. This will ensure the appropriate support is put in place. You can complete an application through a relevant funding body, such as: You will need to provide a copy of your evidence with your DSA application form. This could be either a letter or report from your doctor or consultant, your audiology report or medical evidence or educational psychologist/specialist teacherâ€™s report. Please keep the original evidence or a copy of it as you will require this later. After you have submitted your application, the funding body will send you a letter to confirm that you can book a study needs assessment. At the study needs assessment, the assessor will consider support, study strategies or assistive software you have had previously or are currently accessing. Study aids and strategies relevant to your current course of study will then be considered and where appropriate, there will also be the opportunity to evaluate appropriate assistive technology, aids and equipment.
