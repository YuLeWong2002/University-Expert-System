            "p": "Nottingham Confucius Institute (NCI) recognises the important role volunteers play in our organisation. We are often in need of dedicated individuals to help us carry out our outreach activities including delivering Chinese cultural activities at the University, local schools and community centres across the East Midlands region. By volunteering, you will have the opportunity to introduce the aspects of Chinese culture you love to the outside world. It can be language or calligraphy, Chinese tea or cuisine, traditional instruments or dance, or anything you think is important - your passion and knowledge can be shared and valued! You will also have plenty of opportunities to make friends with both Chinese and Home/EU students through Mandarin Corner and Language Partner programmes.
