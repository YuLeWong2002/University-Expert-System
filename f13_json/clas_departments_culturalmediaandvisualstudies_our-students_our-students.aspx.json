            "p": "Past and current student share what it's really like to study in the Department of Cultural, Media and Visual Studies. Academically, I’ve developed so much through the feedback I get. I make sure to pay attention to every bit of feedback, and if I hear something twice then I know I need to work on that particular area. I looked at the modules and thought they seemed really interesting and applicable to loads of future careers as well. You don’t have to work in a museum when you come out the other end. Having lived in different countries, I have learned that media will always be a product of the society that it's in. And as I already had an interest in sociology, I was really interested in studying the subject from a sociological point of view. \"Archaeology and history of art seem quite different subjects but as they are both concerned with the visual aspect of the subject they're looking at, they actually complement each other quite well.\" I believe the way we talk about things matters, and there is a way we all talk about games that can naturalise that darker side existing in gaming. I'd rather not look away from that and deal with the whole picture. BA History of Art graduate, 2017 BA Film and Television Studies graduate, 2021 BA History of Art graduate, 2019 BA History of Art graduate, 2023 French and Film and Television Studies graduate My role is essentially to report stories. But how that looks can change from day to day. Some days I might be writing copy and editing pictures in the newsroom and then other days, I may be chasing up information for stories from our office and when there is a major news story I could be out assisting a reporter or producer."
