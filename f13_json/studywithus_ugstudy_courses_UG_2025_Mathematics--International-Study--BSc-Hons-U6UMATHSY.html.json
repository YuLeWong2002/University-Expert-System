            "p": "University Park Campus, Nottingham, UK This course provides an exciting opportunity to study mathematics abroad. You can choose from countries including Australia, Canada and many others. The year abroad enables you to experience a new culture and improve your language skills. Are you fascinated by abstract concepts such as infinity and symmetry? Do you want to develop your skills in problem solving and analysis? Our BSc Mathematics (International Study) will prepare you for a career in which you can apply the knowledge and skills you have learnt. The course will enable you to enhance and develop your transferable skills in project work, group study and presentations. Mandatory Year 1 Algebra Applied Mathematics Core Mathematics Probability and Statistics 1 The above is a sample of the typical modules we offer, but is not intended to be construed or relied on as a definitive list of what might be available in any given year. This content was last updated on Monday 25 November 2024. Due to timetabling availability, there may be restrictions on some module combinations. The majority of modules are worth 10 or 20 credits. You will study modules totalling 120 credits in each year. As a guide one credit equates to approximately 10 hours of work. During the first year, you will typically spend approximately: You can attend drop-in sessions each week up to a maximum of two hours and the remaining time will be spent in independent study. In later years, you are likely to spend up to 15 hours per week in lectures and workshops subject to your module selection. In your first year you will meet with your personal tutor every week during term time. In small groups of 5-6 students, you'll run through core topics and practice working together in a group to solve problems and communicate mathematics effectively. All of our modules are delivered by lecturers or professors. PhD students sometimes support problem classes and computing workshops in their areas of expertise. Lectures in the first two years often include at least 200 students but class sizes are much more variable in the third year subject to module selection. The year abroad is at an English-speaking university or with a European partner institution where you will attend lectures in a foreign language (subject to required language competency achieved beforehand). Language modules can be studied in your second year here in Nottingham (up to 20 credits). Studying for a degree at the University of Nottingham will provide you with the type of skills and experiences that will prove invaluable in any career, whichever direction you decide to take. Throughout your time with us, our Careers and Employability Service can work with you to improve your employability skills even further; assisting with job or course applications, searching for appropriate work experience placements and hosting events to bring you closer to a wide range of prospective employers. Have a look at our careers page for an overview of all the employability support and opportunities that we provide to current students. The University of Nottingham is consistently named as one of the most targeted universities by Britain’s leading graduate employers (Ranked in the top ten in The Graduate Market in 2013-2020, High Fliers Research). University Park Campus covers 300 acres, with green spaces, wildlife, period buildings and modern facilities. It is one of the UK's most beautiful and sustainable campuses, winning a national Green Flag award every year since 2003. Living abroad has been one of the best decisions of my life. I’ve met friends from all over the globe, studied maths and communicated in another language and got to really explore Bordeaux and the surrounding places. I now know I can survive in a foreign country and it’s opened my mind up to so many new possibilities in the future. So my advice for those considering doing Mathematics (International Study) would be to do it and for those who haven’t even considered it - try it, you won’t regret it!
