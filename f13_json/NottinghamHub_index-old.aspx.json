            "p": "MyNottingham is the new portal for applicants and students to access services and data. The range of available services is tailored to the individual experience of each user, so an undergraduate student will see something slightly different to a postgraduate student or an applicant. Similarly, a student will only see details about their specific course. As a browser-based system it can be accessed from any location across a variety of devices, 24hrs a day. MyNottingham interfaces with Campus Solutions. Campus Solutions brings financial, admissions and student records together in one system across all three of our campuses. Staff log in to Campus Solutions through MyNottingham.
