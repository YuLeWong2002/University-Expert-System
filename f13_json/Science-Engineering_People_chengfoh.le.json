He was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the School of Pharmacy, UNMC for three years prior to joining the Faculty as an academic. He obtained his PhD from the University of Malaya in 2013 for his research on designing and development of Antimicrobial Peptides (AMPs) as alternative antibiotics against Streptococcus pneumoniae. The significance of his works had been recognised in a number of conferences and symposia. In 2013, Dr Le received the Young Investigator Award in the 9th International Symposium on Antimicrobial Agents and Resistance (ISAAR-9) for his research on the design of a series of novel AMPs which successfully cured the mice from lethal pneumocococal infection. Prior to this, he was awarded the BioInnovation Award during the BioMalaysia 2011 and BioMalaysia 2013. He also won a Silver Medal during the University of Malaya Innovation and Creativity Expo 2010.
