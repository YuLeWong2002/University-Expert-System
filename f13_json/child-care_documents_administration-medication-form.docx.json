            "p": "The person who is the staff member or student at the University needs to complete the application. An application for a place does not guarantee you a place. Our services are very popular and we have a long waiting list, especially for children under two years of age. Early application is strongly advised. Once we have a place available we will make you an offer of a place. If you accept it we will send you a fee spreadsheet, a fee contract, a childcare services contract and other relevant information. To secure a place you will need to complete the paperwork and return it to us with the first month’s fees. Please note that these are non-refundable should you subsequently decide not to take up the place. You will also be asked for a £35 registration fee, which is also non-refundable. If you have any queries about applying, please contact us. We are more than happy to help where we can.
