While each module has its own particular focus, all are concerned with investigating contemporary educational issues in the light of economic and social contexts, appropriate literature and the shared experience of course members. The overall purpose of the Postgraduate Diploma in Education is to deepen and refine your capacity for critical reflection on your practice as well as on the mental models which inform your work. Systematic inquiry is therefore an organising principle that underpins all modules on the programme, and you will be encouraged to identify issues that are significant to you and your organisation. As a school, we are committed to improving and investigating transformative and effective practices in Education. You will study in a supportive, dynamic and inclusive environment with an international team from across the globe. Many of our colleagues are research active with ongoing national and international research grants. The Postgraduate Diploma in Education requires candidates to complete four taught modules with a total value of 120 credits. The 30-credit module Practice Based Inquiry is compulsory for this qualification. This is the only compulsory module. For the remainder of the credits, you can choose from any of the School of Education’s other postgraduate taught modules, including any Educational Leadership and Management (ELM) module, any Special and Inclusive Education (SIE) module and any TESOL module. Each 30-credit module is assessed by a written assignment of 6,000 words (or equivalent). To complete the programme successfully, a pass of 50 must be achieved on each assignment. Practice Based Inquiry The content will involve you in active critical consideration of participating in and leadership of practitioner inquiry in relation to professional context mapping and workplace learning. These processes will be achieved through: This module critically examines contemporary debates surrounding orthodoxies in curriculum, learning and assessment in schools, and how these relate to policy and practice. In particular, it considers the way different orthodoxies frame what children and young people learn in schools, how they learn and how assessment practices inform learning processes. The module will explore these orthodoxies in terms of their origins and purposes and it will consider alternative models from an international perspective. The module starts by considering the history, politics and ideology of the curriculum as it currently exists. It then develops understanding through application of psychological, social and cultural theories of learning and assessment. These theorised views of schooling and classroom practices enable us to analyse and critique the wide-ranging policy and research discussions about curriculum, learning and assessment that are currently underway. You will be engaged in considering how developments of, and alternatives to, current practices will impact learning and teaching in the future. This module looks at how people learn and how learning is supported in a digital age. It explores current and historical theories of learning and how they inform the design of learning technologies. It will help you understand the potential of digital technology for learning in a variety of contexts (such as schools, colleges, workplaces, museums, both face-to-face and online) and help you develop an ability to critically reflect on examples of learning technologies in current use. This module focuses on how people learn together in pairs, teams, small groups, the classroom, or an informal community. It works through classical and modern theories of social learning, explaining the social aspects of almost any type of learning and mechanisms that boost the power of learning together. Equipped with these theories, it explores the various technologies mediating and supporting social learning, such as social media, participation in the World Wide Web, online communities, online communication platforms and virtual reality. The module will address the essential features of effective learning, as relevant to your sector by examining: Programme coordinator: Dr Chai Xun Yu You can view the 2022/2023 course timetable and note this is subject to change.
