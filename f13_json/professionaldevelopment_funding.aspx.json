            "p": "The Individual Development Fund is designed to financially assist all members of staff undertaking vocationally relevant courses/qualifications where no equivalent internal provision is available. Please read these criteria carefully, as your application for funding will be assessed against them. Your application will need to meet all of these criteria to be considered by the IDF panel. Any activity that would normally be funded by a School/Department is excluded from this funding. It will be the judgement of the IDF panel about which applications fall into this category. In exceptional circumstances, where applications to the fund exceed available budget, grant decisions will be taken in the following order. Any applicant, who is rejected on this basis, will be encouraged to apply to the next round of funding. If approved, a maximum of Â£500 will be contributed towards the cost of a course/qualification per academic year. For courses longer than one academic year in duration, the full cost must be broken down into an annual cost. HR will contact applicants on an annual basis to confirm the cost of the subsequent year and that they intend to carry on with their studies. There is no need to re-apply to the fund for continuation of funding. Note: Any member of staff, who receives funding and leaves the University within one year of completing the funded activity, will be expected to pay back the amount of funding granted. How to claim funding if successful: For further information regarding the application process, including criteria for funding, please contact the br-hr-finance@exmail.nottingham.ac.uk.
