            "p": "Non UK students should refer to Train to teach in England as a non-UK citizen | Get Into Teaching GOV.UK Applicants with a degree from outside the UK should refer to Teach in England if you trained outside the UK | Get Into Teaching GOV.UK Student funding for full-time teacher training courses is provided by the Department for Education (DfE) and Student Finance. Bursaries and scholarships are available to trainees on a fee-based teacher training course in England that leads to the award of Qualified Teacher Status. Availability is dependent on your highest relevant academic award and the subject you are studying to teach. To receive a bursary or scholarship you must be entitled to support under the Student Finance England criteria, unless you are studying to teach Languages or Physics. Information about Scholarships and Bursaries from Get Into Teaching You can also, if eligible, apply for a maintenance loan and tuition fee loan from Student Finance. The funding package is the same one as offered to undergraduate students so please go to the funding for undergraduate students page for more information. Apply to Student Finance for funding University Bursaries and Scholarships Students studying courses through the SCITT Programme (where the School/Academy (eg EMTTP or SWIFT) is the main course provider, rather than the University) should apply for funding from Student Finance using the School/Academy as the institution they are studying at. They will also be the contact point for any Student Finance query. SCITT students (or students on any similar course where the University of Nottingham is not the main training provider) are not eligible for additional financial support from the University of Nottingham."
