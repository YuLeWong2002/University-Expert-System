            "p": "Our research is unified by a common concern with social justice. This means addressing the realities of marginalised groups, giving witness to experiences of everyday life, identifying issues of recognition and representation, and informing policy, practice and the wider public. One of our aims is to promote knowledge exchange through close partnerships with stakeholders, including working together with service users, government departments, national charities, and third sector organisations. Our research centres provide a forum for collaboration and exchange of ideas and ensure that our impact is meaningful and enduring. Our research is conducted through our research centres, delivering high-quality research under our ten themes, grouping together staff with similar interests. Ruby Chau is an Associate Professor with a primary interest in informing policy and practice to improve peopleâ€™s lives and promote social development. ENQUIRE is a blog and conference, run by our postgraduates, providing an encouraging and exciting space for postgraduate academic research.
