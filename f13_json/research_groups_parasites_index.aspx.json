            "p": "The parasitology group studies parasites ranging from intracellular protozoa, such as Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum, to large multi-cellular worms including Fasciola hepatica. Areas of investigation include: • The function of parasite-derived molecules in controlling host immunity thereby enhancing survival of both pathogen and host. • The role of macrophages, T-cells and regulatory cytokines in controlling parasitic infection and the effects of these in bystander infection. • Various aspects of protozoa infection including neuroparasitology, stress tolerance in T. gondii, bradyzoite-tachyzoite conversion, and the development of novel invertebrate models of infection.
