            "p": "Federal student loans for American students The USA's Federal Student Aid (FSA) programme provides student loans for American students, covering or contributing to the costs of your tuition fees, living expenses, travel and other study expenses. The University of Nottingham can certify Federal Direct Loan applications for students studying at our UK campuses, up to the full value of your Cost of Attendance (CoA). Our School Code for federal loans and FAFSA applications is G08920. Not all degree programmes and subject areas are eligible for loans, so check that your chosen course qualifies. Your eligibility for a loan and the amount you can borrow will be determined by FSA when you apply. Loan applications are handled through FSA's online application process. For further guidance see our American student loans and federal aid webpages. See our information for students from the USA for guidance on Nottingham's entry requirements for US students. Offered by Federal Student Aid (U.S. Department of Education) For any enquiries about studying at the University of Nottingham with a federal loan, contact us on federal-aid@nottingham.ac.uk"
