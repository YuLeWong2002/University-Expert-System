            "p": "Welcome to the School of Mathematical Sciences. We are responsible for the teaching of mathematics of undergraduate levels across the various engineering departments. The School of Mathematical Sciences offers two undergraduate courses: BSc (Hons) Mathematics and Management, jointly with the Nottingham University Business School, and BSc (Hons) Mathematics and Data Science, jointly with the School of Computer Science. The courses provide a grounding in relevant mathematical concepts and techniques, combined with substantial degree-level studies in management or data science. Apart from our teaching responsibility, the faculty members also actively engage in a wide range of research areas such as fractional calculus, nonassociative algebra, mathematics education, data envelopment and stochastic frontier analysis, statistics and its application in genetics, biotechnology, engineering and other areas.
