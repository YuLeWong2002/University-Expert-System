            "p": "The Campus Services Committee (CSC) is a group of key people involved with ensuring that UNM is a safe and fun environment in which to live, work and study. We seek to hear the voice of our entire campus community on services supplied across campus. We have set up dedicated Facebook groups to serve as forums for feedback so that it is easier to communicate with you. If you want your voice heard please use the correct channels; but please be aware that we do listen. It is through CSC that we have improved many facilities including provision of new facilities (e.g. BBQ pits) that otherwise wouldnâ€™t have been thought about. Do keep the ideas coming. With the SAM eTicketing system, you can submit online support request for matters related to security, accommodation and maintenance. This service is available for all University students, staff and associates. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8001"
