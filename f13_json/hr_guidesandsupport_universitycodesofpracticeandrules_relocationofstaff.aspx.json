            "p": "Whilst every effort will be made by the University to maintain the initial location of the employment of an employee within the University, it may be necessary because of restructuring strategies to change the location of jobs. Nothing in this agreement overrides or negates individual contract terms regarding location or mobility. If job changes, involving relocation, are planned within a School or Department, there will be a process of consultation with all of the employees concerned, and the relevant staff representatives and/or trade union representatives who must be employees of the University, at the earliest opportunity."
