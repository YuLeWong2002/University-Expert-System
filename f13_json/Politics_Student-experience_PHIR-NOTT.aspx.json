            "p": "PHIR-NOTT (pronounced ‘fear not’) is the student group for the School of Politics, History and International Relations (PHIR). It was established in September 2011 by the pioneer batch of undergraduate students with the aim of providing a platform for all PHIR students to explore their interests in international affairs during the course of their studies at UNMC. PHIR-NOTT seeks to enrich the university experience of PHIR students with regards to academic, social and other related issues. PHIR-NOTT’s activities have included educational trips to the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot, and panel discussion sessions: most recently on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict with the presence of expert guest speakers as well as embassy representatives. PHIR-NOTT’s remit extends beyond the seminar room. The group organises recreational trips such as paintballing, lunches and dinners off-campus in informal settings to give students relief from their studies, and promote closer understanding and relations between the students and staff.
