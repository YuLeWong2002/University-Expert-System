We are looking for 24 students to work in partnership with us - could you be who weâ€™re looking for? Student partners will work alongside School Directors of Education and Student Experience on one of the focus areas above. You will attend focus group meetings (2 hours) on the topic and will then work together in a group with other students and the Director of ESE on a co-authored analytic report and action plan to improve this area for students in Arts. You can find out more about the role, and pay, in this document. To apply, download the application form and send it to arts-ese@nottingham.ac.uk by 12 noon on 25 January 2023. Good luck!"
