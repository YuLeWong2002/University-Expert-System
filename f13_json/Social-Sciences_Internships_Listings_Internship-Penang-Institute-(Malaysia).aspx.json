Under the programme, which will run all year round, interns will be able to gain first-hand experience working with policy experts, government agencies and NGOs. Each intern will be designated a project according to their interests and academic background, and will be placed under the supervision of a mentor. Being a state-linked think tank, Penang Institute will be able to offer interns the chance to participate and contribute meaningfully towards the nation wide issues. The internship period must be a minimum of one month and a maximum of four months. At the end of the internship programme, interns are expected to give an internal presentation and publish at least one article based on their research topics. A small token of allowance will be given to successful interns. However, candidates are expected to bear all costs of living during the period of internship (including board, lodging and travel). The programme seeks talents with a passion for public policy issues and is open to both local and international undergraduate/postgraduate students and fresh graduates.
