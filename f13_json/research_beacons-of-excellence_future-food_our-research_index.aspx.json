            "p": "Thank you for your interest. Future Food Beacon closed in July 2023 and these pages will not be further updated. We thank all those involved in making the Beacon a success. The University of Nottingham Food Systems Institute launched in Aug 2023 please visit their webpages for more information. Our teams are working across the food system to explore ways to future proof food security ‘Hidden hunger,’ less diverse diets, naturally low nutrients in our staple crops, and an increasing reliance on over-processed foods mean that more than a quarter of the world’s population is not getting the goodness they need from what they eat. Our researchers are tapping into their expertise across the food chain – from soil to molecule to meal – to deliver sustainable solutions to global food challenges. How can we develop crops and livestock that are resilient to climate change? What is needed to give access to healthier, safer, nutritious food? What innovations can tackle health and healthy aging challenges? Developing new ways to process and manufacture foods.
