            "p": "We understand that roles can change. They might become more complex or increase in responsibility. We have a procedure in place that means we can consider regrading roles. For a role to be regraded, it needs to meet the criteria for a higher level within the relevant job family. If you wish for a role to be considered for regrading, you’ll need to follow our application process. The regrading procedure applies to you if you’re in the Technical Services (TS), Administrative, Professional and Managerial (APM) or the Operations and Facilities (O&F) job family. The process runs three times a year, giving all our units the flexibility to apply to HR for a role to be considered for regrading. A-Z of services A-Z of policies Forms"
