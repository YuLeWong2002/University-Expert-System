            "p": "The WHSCR centre brings together a wide range of multidisciplinary researchers concerned with different aspects of people's wellbeing. Our centre focuses on theory, policy and practice in relation to health and social care both in the UK and internationally. We are interested in exploring how children, young people and vulnerable adults can best be supported and protected by health and social care policies, services and interventions. The WHSCR centre places emphasis on the lived experiences of patients, service-users, children in public care and their families. We are also interested in examining the ways in which practitioners intervene with individuals and families and how this is framed by government policies and broader societal norms. The WHSCR centre supports an ambitious and vibrant research culture by proactively engaging with the dynamics of national and global systems, which shape new agendas. WHSCR is embedded in a number of wider networks of scholars, policy-makers (Ann Craft Trust, Applied Research Collaboration East Midlands, Institute of Mental Health), practitioners (D2N2 Network, Respond, Nottinghamshire NHS Trust) and service-users (INVOLVE and SEA) that support the centre in achieving internationally excellent and world-leading research. WHSCR supports the activities of both academic staff and doctoral research students through: School of Sociology and Social Policy Law and Social Sciences building University of Nottingham University Park Nottingham, NG7 2RD telephone: +44 (0)115 84 66394"
