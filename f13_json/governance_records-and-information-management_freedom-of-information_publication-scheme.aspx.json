Information is classified by type to make it easier for people outside the University to find. The University of Nottingham Publication Scheme has been organised in line with the Information Commissioner's Model Publication Scheme for Universities. The Publication Scheme is currently under review and the updated information will be published during Summer 2018. The Scheme is a guide to the information the University intends to publish routinely to comply with its obligations under the Freedom of Information Act.
