            "p": "Each graduating student attending a ceremony was entitled to two free guest tickets as long as you registered by 5pm on 8 November. Guests will receive a wristband which will allow each guest entry to the ceremony hall. Student tickets and guest wristbands will be issued as part of the student check-in process on the day of your ceremony. Children under the age of two can sit on the lap of the accompanying adult and don't require their own ticket. Advance ticket sales are now closed. There may be the option to purchase extra tickets in person on the day from the graduation marquee, depending on how busy your ceremony is. Important information: Ceremonies will be streamed live at East Midlands Conference Centre, for those who would like to attend but don't have a ticket. The live stream will also be available to view on our website."
