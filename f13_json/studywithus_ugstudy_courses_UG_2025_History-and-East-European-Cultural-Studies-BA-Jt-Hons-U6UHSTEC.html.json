I felt a History single honours may have been too intense and too broad for my preferences, so I began looking into joint honours courses. I was really intrigued by the concept of East European Cultural Studies, as it was a subject area that hadn’t been offered to me before. I also enjoy learning about the social and cultural elements of history, and this course allowed me to focus on those elements more closely.
