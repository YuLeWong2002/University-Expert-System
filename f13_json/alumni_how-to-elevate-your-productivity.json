            "p": "Join recording artist and motivational speaker Shivali Bhammer (Economics and Philosophy, 2008), as she shares her advice on how to design goals which will elevate your productivity. Shivali also works in the Investment Banking Group at Raymond James and is a writer. She'll help you learn how to design goals that align with your nature, detaching yourself from their outcome, and navigate the need to compete with others versus competing with yourself. Speaker: Shivali Bhammer (Economics and Philosophy, 2008) With over two decades of HR experience in multiple industries, Rebecca Khor Ying Ying (Executive MBA, 2020) is the perfect person to share what makes a great HR leader! The title of British Ambassador is one which might evoke thoughts of exotic far-flung destinations, intrigue and glamorous dinners. But is it the reality? John Pearson (Geography, 1990) gives us an insight into his job as British Ambassador to Laos. Over his 36-year career, Sir John Sawers (Physics and Philosophy, 1976) held many of the most senior positions in the foreign affairs, diplomatic relations and national security fields, culminating in five years as the Chief of MI6. He explains how he has taken his career in new directions and how he uses his expertise in his roles today. Build confidence and provide practical tools to utilise now and in the future."
