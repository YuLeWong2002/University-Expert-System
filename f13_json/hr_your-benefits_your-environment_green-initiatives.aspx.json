As a member of staff, you will benefit through a number of areas: We are actively reducing our carbon-footprint, promote recycling and encourage cycling, walking and the use of public transport through a range of discounts. We are really proud of our extensive landscaped, award-winning grounds and are continually investing to make them the best they can be. University Park is our largest campus at 300 acres and is widely regarded as one of the most attractive in the country, set in extensive greenery and around a lake. The campus has been a Civic Trust Green Flag Award Winner every year since 2003 - the only university campus to achieve this status. As a member of staff, you can enjoy the walks, parks and gardens in stunning scenery which feature: We've devised a series of garden walk guides.
