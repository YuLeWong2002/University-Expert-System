            "p": "Our vision is to accelerate the translation of zero carbon research into high-impact commercial and policy solutions – in partnership with industry and government. We are working to consolidate the East Midlands’ position as a world leader in the development and deployment of innovation in green industries and advanced manufacturing. In the future we will continue to expand our zero carbon approaches including energy, food and materials. To build a globally significant Zero Carbon Cluster in the East Midlands, our team of researchers from across disciplines are working with a wide range of cross-sector partners. This includes higher education and further education institutions, local councils, industries and economic development institutions. Together, we will attract and support top global firms, cultivate local innovation, train our people in the skills needed for the net zero transition, and serve as a global model for a flourishing zero carbon economy. In one of the largest funding injections the East Midlands has ever seen, the university has secured more than £70m to establish new world-leading and open-access research facilities and programmes that will decarbonise future transport. The University of Nottingham, in collaboration with Loughborough University, has been selected to receive a significant funding boost from East Midlands Freeport to accelerate the translation of zero carbon research into high-impact commercial and policy solutions. Social science research at the University of Nottingham is helping to shape a more sustainable future. Our pioneering researchers deliver solutions to complex global challenges. We are committed to making an outstanding contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Contact us at zerocarboncluster@nottingham.ac.uk"
