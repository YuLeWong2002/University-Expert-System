We're constantly upgrading our buildings and technology to meet the latest learning, research and workplace needs. “Engineering isn't just sitting in a classroom or listening to lectures, it's hands-on learning. Using facilities like the wind tunnels, building gliders and working on project weeks. Those parts of it are so much fun.” Emma Tardrew – MEng Aerospace Engineering student Our graduates are highly sought after by employers in the UK and internationally, because we teach the technical and professional skills you need to be work-ready.
