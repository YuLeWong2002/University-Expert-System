            "p": "Discover how our researchers will deliver a new generation of aircraft – clean, sustainable, safe and silent – and help the world achieve its zero carbon targets. The UK was the first major aviation sector in the world to commit to net zero CO₂ by 2050. Achieving net zero aviation will take coordinated and determined action, taking in clean aircraft technologies and propulsion systems, sustainable aviation fuels, advances in materials, manufacturing and aircraft maintenance and more efficient airspace and airport operations. With the support of partners including Boeing, Airbus, Rolls-Royce and Leonardo, our ambition is to make the East Midlands the world’s foremost location for low-carbon aerospace innovation. \"COP27 is an opportunity for our scientists and engineers to come together with aviation companies and policy makers to find solutions to a global crisis of great urgency. I am proud that our researchers remain defiant and dedicated in the face of this complex challenge, and that the University of Nottingham, through innovation and collaboration, is in the vanguard as the UK takes a global lead in securing net zero aviation.\" Helping flights become cleaner, greener and safer. Greener alternatives to current aviation fuels. Advanced battery technology transforming the future of flight. Understanding technology for the next generation of plane engines. The new processes that are key to achieving jet zero success. World-leading centre at the forefront of zero carbon aviation. The computer scientist solution to managing runways that can make our skies cleaner. Engineers use robots to fix aircraft from 1000s of miles away. A net zero aviation revolution driven by small advances on many fronts. A cleaner and most cost-effective aerospace supply chain."
