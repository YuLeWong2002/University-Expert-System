            "p": "We want YOU! ECRN is a network, and networks rely on all of their members - not just those 'at the top'. We try and keep things as egalitarian and inclusive as possible - because we think that's the right kind of environment for nurturing and enthusing a research community. Here's a bit more about who we are and what we do - drop us a line if you're keen to get involved! telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8001 email: ecrn@nottingham.edu.my"
