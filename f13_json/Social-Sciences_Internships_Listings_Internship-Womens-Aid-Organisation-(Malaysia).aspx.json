WAO offers shelter for abused women and their children as well as a centre for WAO activities on family, women and domestic violence. Social workers in WAO also offer face to face counselling and telephone counselling as well as assist in basic legal queries. WAO also acts as a centre for the children of WAO's ex-residents who have decided to live independently. The children are given a home, education at local schools and a support system to meet their physical, mental and emotional needs. The WAO Centre is both an administrative centre and a centre where advocacy and public education programmes are organised. WAO plays a key role with other women's groups and civil society groups to advocate for law and policy reform. Fundraising and public education activities are also the responsibility of the WAO Centre.
