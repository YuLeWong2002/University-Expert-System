            "p": "This is the webpage for Professor Jonas Emsley's research group. This group carries out structural studies of platelet receptors and blood coagulation factors. To understand the molecular basis of human disease using protein crystallography as the principal technique This movie shows a crystal structure which is a complex between a peptide inhibitor (coloured cyan) with the platelet receptor glycoprotein Ib (coloured green) Current projects are studying coagulation factors from the contact system and platelet glycoprotein Ib structure and the molecular basis of platelet and hematological disorders. 1. Coagulation Factor XI and the contact system . The safer anticoagulation project. 2. Glycoprotein Ib-V-IX (GPIb) receptor complex 3. Bernard Soulier syndrome Notable results inlcude the blood coagulation Factor XI structure, platelet glycoprotein Ib inhibitor complex and glycoprotein Ib beta subunit stucture (see movies). This movie shows a model of the platelet glycoprotein Ib membrane proximal domains and transmembrane helices. The content for these pages was originally provided by our summer student Noren Pisani.
