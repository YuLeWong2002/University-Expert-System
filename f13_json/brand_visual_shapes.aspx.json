            "p": "We’ve called this page Shapes, but really it’s all about squares. Squares are simple, neat and flexible. They also reflect the castle square of our logo, which helps people to recognise us straight away. The square device is not a mandatory element of the brand identity, but is a tool that can be used to add layers of interest and/or create hierarchy when needed. The device can be used in the following ways: Montages can be created by layering squares in a variety of scales. If montages include two squares at the same scale, overlapped at a central point, this central square should be a solid colour, to avoid creating overly complex layers of imagery. This method can be used creatively on a variety of formats. To ensure the outlined square always appears consistent, line weights have been set based on the size of the asset. This is however just a guide and you should ensure visually the square is in line with the examples shown on this page."
