            "p": "Deposits for foundation and taught masters courses as part of your visa preparations under the Student route. International students preparing for a foundation course or a postgraduate taught masters degree course at Nottingham who will require a student visa (formerly a Tier 4 visa) must usually pay a tuition fee deposit as part of their visa preparation process, in order to receive a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS). This is separate from the course deposits required for some postgraduate masters courses in our Business School and School of Medicine, and some students may need to pay both deposits. You can find out more about the visa application process in our 10 step guide. If you have any further questions about tuition fee deposits, please do not hesitate to contact the Visa and Immigration team on: immigration-support@nottingham.ac.uk email list: Please see our contacts page"
