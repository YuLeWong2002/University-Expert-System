            "p": "The Postgraduate Showcase (formerly known as Research Showcase) is an annual competition for graduate students to display their research to peers, colleagues and academic staff across all University of Nottingham campuses. The competition is typically held each spring and is comprised of several rounds which include the submission of a press release, participation in a research workshop exhibition and a poster competition. The Postgraduate Showcase is an excellent opportunity for graduates to interact with fellow students from other schools and faculties, develop their presentation and communication skills and most importantly, gain valuable experience engaging with a wider audience. Students will benefit from specialist training and support throughout the competition and have the opportunity to seek advice from academics and members of professional funding organisations. An announcement will be made early year alerting students to the opening of the competition. For more information about the Postgraduate Showcase contact Graduate School. email:graduateschool@nottingham.edu.my"
