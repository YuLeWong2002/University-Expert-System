            "p": "The LCD display is an internal communications channel where the main target audience is on-campus students. We run advertising campaigns across campus, such as awards received, VIP visits, celebrations, as well as major events such as open days, news items promoting recruitment, research and global profile. Except for cases of 'breaking newsâ€™, banners are scheduled two (2) weeks in advance. The content then needs to be approved by the relevant department. For more information on student-related activities, please contact Gerard from Student Association. For corporate-related announcements, please contact Diana at Corporate Marketing. To include content on the digital signage, email the completed request form to Diana Chee at Corporate Marketing. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8001 email: enquiries@nottingham.edu.my"
