            "p": "We are an established multi-disciplinary research group encompassing gastroenterology and MRI physics. We develop new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods that we can use to study how the gut works, and how this function is changed in disease and in response to foods and to drugs. We collaborate with academic physiologists, food scientists, surgeons, pharmaceutical scientists, sport scientists and partners from the food and pharmaceutical industries in the UK and across the world. Over the last 3 decades we have established MRI as a non-invasive method of quantifying key aspects of normal healthy gut function and how it is altered in disease. We have developed and validated a range of MRI methods of measuring key parameters including gastric emptying, small bowel water content, motility of the small and large bowel, colonic volume and water content, and transit time. We also study bowel wall permeability and bowel wall inflammation and fibrosis. We take a whole-body approach when required, for instance studying brain/GI interactions. We use these measures to study postprandial fluid fluxes and the gastro-colonic response to feeding. We use this to study Postgraduate research in the School of Medicine More news from the Nottingham Digestive Diseases Centre Sir Peter Mansfield Magnetic Resonance Centre NDDC Biomedical Research Centre GI_MRI@nottingham.ac.uk The University of Nottingham School of Medicine Nottingham, NG7 2UH email:GI_MRI@nottingham.ac.uk"
