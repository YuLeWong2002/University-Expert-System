            "p": "The Environmental Fluid Mechanics and Geoprocesses (EFMG) research group includes academics and researchers from Civil Engineering and Chemical and Environmental Engineering. We work in a variety of ways including in the field, in our Environmental Fluid Mechanics Research Laboratory, theoretically and numerically. Our researchers come from a range of science, mathematics, geology and engineering backgrounds and the types of problems we study mirrors that breadth. We have expertise from porous-media flows with a geo-energy application to coastal sediment transport and extreme wave dynamics to ice and avalanche dynamics.
