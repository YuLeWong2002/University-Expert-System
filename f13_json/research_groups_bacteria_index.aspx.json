The key aims of our group are to: (i) understand the requirements of different bacteria in their environment by analysis of genomes, transcriptomes and proteomes; (ii) develop methods to control enteric disease by studying antigen delivery and potential immune avoidance by phase-variation; and (iii) investigate alternative treatments of bacterial infection in the face of rapidly rising antibiotic resistance, including: (a) bacteriophage â€“ viruses that infect bacteria and (b) Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, a bacterium that preys upon Gram negative bacteria such as Salmonella and E. coli. Our research is carried out on a range of pathogens (including Clostridium, Campylobacter, Listeria, Streptococcus, Salmonella, Dichelobacter, Fusobacterium, Bdellovibrio, Vibrio and Mycobacteria), many of which infect livestock and have zoonotic potential.
