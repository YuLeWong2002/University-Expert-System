            "p": "As the first British university to have a full-fledged international campus, The University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus (UNMC) celebrates its 15th anniversary this year in a land that is truly Asia. Enriching Lives with Global Education is the theme to commemorate this milestone; which epitomises the university's commitment in providing an international education experience, while inspiring our students and staff to improve the academic and professional communities they belong to worldwide. The theme also threads through the University's continuous and multifaceted initiatives in the areas of student engagement, teaching and learning, research, business engagement and corporate partnerships, community outreach and philanthropy, all of which personify the founding of our institution. As part of the 15th anniversary celebration, we had a campaign in July where we welcomed questions from anyone for our Provost Christine.
