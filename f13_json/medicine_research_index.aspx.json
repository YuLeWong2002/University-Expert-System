            "p": "We are world leaders in transdisciplinary medical research that transforms people’s health and well-being. Through collaborations with healthcare and industry, we respond to today’s research challenges to translate our research into interventions that benefit patients and populations. The School of Medicine has a vision to build an environment where excellent worthwhile research can flourish and where new discoveries across a broad range of topics and environments can translate into better wellbeing and health for people across the world. It is truly inspiring to see how our research moves from concepts to laboratories to pilot studies, then clinical trials to clinical guidelines and finally into real-world settings. Our ambition is for our research to be the best it can be in driving improvements in people's health and wellbeing in the UK and worldwide. --- Professor Michael Akeroyd Interim Director of Research and Knowledge Exchange, School of Medicine Contacts: Call 0115 823 0031 ext.30031 or please see our 'contact us' page for further details"
