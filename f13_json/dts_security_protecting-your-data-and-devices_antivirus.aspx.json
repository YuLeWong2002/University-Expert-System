When working away from the university, ensure you connect to the Virtual Private Network (VPN) for at least two hours each week so any necessary updates can be installed on your device. Examples of free antivirus software are Microsoft Defender, AVG, Avast, Avira Free Antivirus, BitDefender Antivirus Free Edition and Panda Free Antivirus. After you have installed antivirus software on your personal device, set it to scan the whole device for malware at least once a week.
