            "p": "The staff of Russian and Slavonic Studies at the University of Nottingham would like to express their deep concern over the Russian invasion of Ukraine as an act of aggression against a sovereign country. Our thoughts are with the Ukrainian people and everybody who is affected by Putin's war on Ukraine, including our students in the UK as well as our friends and colleagues in Slavonic countries. In these dark times, we remain committed to the close personal and intellectual links with our Ukrainian and Russian colleagues, friends and relatives who oppose Putin’s war. Year Abroad The current conflict in Ukraine means that, like other UK institutions, the university is unable to send students to Russia for their year abroad at the moment, and so we are pursuing other options for language courses in neighbouring countries (e.g. Estonia and Latvia) and where Russian is used by a native speaking community, and/or online if necessary. This is the approach being taken by other UK universities offering degrees in Russian. We expect that students will still undertake a period of time abroad during their degree, and are confident that alternative options will meet the learning needs of students, providing them with ample opportunity to develop their language and intercultural skills. We will of course keep the situation under regular review over the coming months and will keep students updated about their year abroad options throughout their university career.
