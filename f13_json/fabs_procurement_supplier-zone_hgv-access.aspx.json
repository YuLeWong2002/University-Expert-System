            "p": "Restrictions on Access to University Park Campus for HGV Vehicles. Please note the arrangements to exclude HGV access on to the University Park campus during core hours of 8.30am to 5.00pm, Monday to Friday. However, when access is necessary larger vehicles and HGVs are advised to use either North, West or South entrances and NOT to use Coates Road entrance. These restrictions were introduced in response to the increased vehicle congestion resulting from University expansion and as a health and safety measure to reduce the risk of accidents on the campus road network. The restrictions are similar to operating arrangements in place in many city centre locations and we would expect all existing suppliers and contractors to amend their arrangements in order to comply. For the purpose of these restrictions, the definition of HGV is a road vehicle exceeding 3500 kilograms when in normal laden use. Buses and coaches are exempt. Please contact the Security Office in relation to information or issues relating to these restrictions. Call us on 0115 951 6666 or email us at: Your co-operation in this matter is very much appreciated. Director of Estates King's Meadow Campus Lenton Lane Nottingham, NG7 2NR For queries please email procurement@nottingham.ac.uk."
