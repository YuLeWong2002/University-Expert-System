            "p": "\"I had an amazing experience studying at The University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus! The lecturers are knowledgeable in their fields, passionate about education and very approachable. The masters class schedules also offer great flexibility for students who are working. In addition, my experience as a research assistant at the School of Education taught me so much about the education scene in Malaysia and enabled me to gain valuable research skills. Indeed, working and studying presented quite a challenge, but it taught me to manage my time better and to prioritise tasks. The MA Special Needs programme has definitely provided me with knowledge and skills that are important for my career and thus, I highly recommend joining this programme at The University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus!\" Constance MA Special Needs, UNMC (2017) BA Psychology (Hons) Post Graduate Diploma in Education \"The Master's in Education programme at UNMC was an informative, engaging and an exciting programme. Despite having the programme prearranged to core modules and delivered in Sri Lanka the education and experiences Iâ€™ve received thus far has been invaluable. The programme is conveniently planned according to SL school holidays. The intense delivery of five-day lectures was overwhelming. Nevertheless, the lecturers, peers and access to moodle made it feasible. The skilled lecturers have been of great support and continuously challenged me to grow as an educator and a reflective practitioner. I would highly recommend this programme to anyone seeking quality education\". Haiza Mazahim MA Education, UNMC (2016) Sri Lanka Cohort telephone: +6 (03) 8725 3717 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8020"
