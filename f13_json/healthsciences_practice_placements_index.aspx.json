            "p": "Health and healthcare professionals of the future need to ensure that they meet the requirements of relevant professional bodies, including Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC), Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) and British Association of Sport Rehabilitators and Trainers (BASRaT). The requirements are in place to ensure all professionals are fit, caring, responsible individuals who are safe and competent to care for vulnerable patients and clients during their careers. The School of Health Sciences at The University of Nottingham will ensure that their graduates are of the highest standards and fit to care for patients. In order to do this, we will make certain that they meet all professional requirements in terms of their attitude and behaviour. To achieve this, we have a very robust system which enables the public, other students and professionals to identify issues of concern, which may have a number of outcomes â€“ in terms of identifying students who need help and support as well as managing those whose behaviour falls short of our high standards. Additionally, placement areas undergo a vigorous educational audit process which occurs every three years as a minimum in line with professional body and university quality standards. We are fully committed that the future healthcare workforce is fit for purpose and graduates from the School of Health Sciences display the highest possible level of professionalism and conduct. The process for raising concerns about a practice placement or a student are intended to provide an effective means for identifying and dealing with concerns.
