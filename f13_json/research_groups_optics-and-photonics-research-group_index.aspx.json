            "p": "The Optics and Photonics Research Group works on a wide range of topics from the basic, fundamental sciences of the way that light and sound behave, all the way to applications of this science in industry and healthcare. This has led to development of varied technologies, such as microscopes that can use ultrasound to image inside of single cells to clothing that can monitor the health and well-being of patients. The group is one of the largest research groups in the Faculty of Engineering with 12 academics. The group has impacted several sectors, from the design of new light microscope accessories to accurately measuring neonatal heart-rates. Two of the Facultyâ€™s spin-out companies (Monica Healthcare and Surepulse) have originated in technology developed by the Optics and Photonics Research Group.
