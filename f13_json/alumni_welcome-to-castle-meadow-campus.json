            "p": "In exciting news for the university, this new city centre site will soon become the first addition to our campus footprint in Nottingham since the opening of the Jubilee Campus in 1999. Before the opportunity to acquire the Castle Meadow site arose, the university had planned new buildings for the Business School, opening in 2026, and for our Digital Nottingham project, opening in 2024. Plans for these new buildings can now be replaced by facilities on the Castle Meadow campus, available for initial use from 2023. The University Strategy places a special emphasis on environmental sustainability and supporting the city’s ambitions to become net zero carbon by 2028. Making use of existing buildings rather than creating new ones is a significantly more sustainable solution. A number of likely core uses for the new campus have already been identified: Our university community will be at the heart of shaping our new spaces, helping us decide what the campus will become – reflecting our values, vision and strategy at a department, school, faculty and university level. These are just some of the themes we’ll be exploring over the coming months using surveys, workshops and other consultation events. You can keep up to date on our Castle Meadow Campus project website or contact us. One of our oldest and most loved halls, take a look round Florence Boot after its year-long refurbishment. From India to China, Lagos to London, we've been celebrating 25 years of the Business School with our international alumni community.

Five things you need to know from around the university - and beyond - during February. This month, Pryzm is no more!"
