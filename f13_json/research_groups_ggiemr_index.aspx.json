            "p": "Electromagnetics is fundamental to our everyday lives and equipment, such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and mobile phones. As an international centre of expertise in electromagnetics, the Institute is a global research leader in the areas of photonic and optoelectronic simulation, simulation for electromagnetic compatibility and power quality, and the transmission line modelling method (TLM). Applications of the research from the Institute include the use of infra-red signals for early detection of cancers; the development of the latest wireless chip-to-chip wireless communications; wave propagation control technologies; and expertise in simulation of lightning protection and cable fault location. The group also pursues research that will ensure that electronic equipment does not interfere with other electronic equipment or systems, improving safety in a number of industries including communications, transportation, aerospace and the nuclear industry.
