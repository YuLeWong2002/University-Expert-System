It also serves as an opportunity to inspire and empower future generations. This yearâ€™s Black History Month theme, Reclaiming Narratives, marks a significant shift towards recognising and correcting the narratives of Black history and culture. By emphasising this theme, we shine a brighter light on stories, allegories, and histories that underscore our commitment to correcting historical inaccuracies and showcasing the untold success stories and the full complexity of Black heritage. The university and our Student's Union will be hosting a number of events, workshops and gatherings to celebrate Black History Month 2024.
