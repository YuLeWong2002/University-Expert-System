            "p": "Closely related fields of study, operations management and information systems are both vital to business across the public and private sectors. With a great diversity of thought, we cover a wide range of key topics in the department, and colleagues in the faculty adopt an interdisciplinary research approach, blending research and teaching seamlessly to provide an eclectic experience for our students. We aim to better understand the relationships between information systems, work and organisation and to develop new tools and methodologies for enhancing system design. Operations management applies sophisticated methods to solving business problems related to designing, planning, controlling and improving operations, logistics and supply chain management processes. New information technologies to support them are continually evolving. Meanwhile, information systems focuses on bridging the divide between computer science and business management, incorporating a range of approaches for designing and applying information technology solutions to organisations. The Operations Management and Information Systems department is a diverse group with wide-ranging expertise. We work across disciplinary boundaries and with practitioners across the public, private and third sectors to tackle real world challenges, notably social and environmental issues. We are driven by a shared passion to make a difference both through our research and our engagement with students.
