            "p": "Welcome checklists As a degree apprentice, your time with us may look a little different to that of our campus-based students. But you can still make the most of your university experience, as we have plenty of resources and support for you to access - whether you're on campus or working remotely. Check your personal email inbox four weeks before you are due to start your course. You will receive an email containing your student ID â€“ this is what you'll need to activate your IT account. Start your IT induction and check what equipment you need to get started on your course. Can't find an email from us? Contact degree-apprenticeships@nottingham.ac.uk After you've activated your IT account, you will receive an email to your university account asking you to register online. You must log on to the NottinghamHub using your new university username and password to complete registration. We strongly encourage you to complete your registration as early as possible, as failure to do so will limit your access to programme materials, undertake assessments as well as progressing on your programme. Once you've activated your IT account you will receive an email to your university email address asking you to upload a photo for your university card. You will need your university username and password, and a digital passport sized photo saved as a .jpg. As an apprentice learner you should still complete this step, as this will give you access to our library system including online materials. Please note that you will not be sent a university card directly but your programme team will coordinate how you receive your card. If you have any questions please contact degree-apprenticeships@nottingham.ac.uk Log in to Moodle with your university username and password and start exploring your school/department pages. You'll find lots of information and resources to help you prepare for your course, but please allow for up to three days after you have registered for your mandatory modules to appear. You will be able to view your academic timetable online closer to your course start date. If you have any questions please contact: degree-apprenticeships@nottingham.ac.uk If you have a smart phone, make sure you download the MyNottingham app for quick access to emails, maps, library account and academic timetables. From wifi access to storage solutions to digital security and printing on campus, Digital Technology Services (DTS) are here to help you with all of your digital needs. Online and digital tools are also available to you to assist with your learning, including Office 365 and Microsoft Teams to name a few. Find out what tools are available to you and learn a bit about how you can use them. Plan your travel to and around campus including maps, directions and car parking information."
