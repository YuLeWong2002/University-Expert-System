            "p": "How to make use of locally available materials to build our engine and how to reduce the losses inside the engine is our main stumbling block. If we achieve these two main goals we will be able to produce a cheap engine that can improve the lives of many people in rural areas. This research could have an impact on a global scale and could benefit the lives of millions of people around the world who don’t currently have access to reliable electricity for their everyday uses. I’m particularly interested in how to produce cooling from thermo-acoustic sources. Now we have an engine that can convert to useful energy, but we want to use the heat from cooking stoves to produce cooling for other applications. The University of Nottingham is providing a lot of resources in terms of facilities and funds. The global nature of the University gives us opportunities to collaborate with researchers from the different campuses improving our strength in this field.
