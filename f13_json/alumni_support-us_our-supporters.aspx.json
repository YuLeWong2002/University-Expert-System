            "p": "Our supporters make the incredible happen - helping progress life-changing research for children with brain tumours, discovering new insights into diseases like breast cancer and dementia, and helping thousands of students from all backgrounds to achieve more than they ever thought possible. We thank everyone who supports us - in ways large and small. Every penny given and every minute of time shared, fuels our ability to positively change the lives of people in Nottingham and around the world. We recognise the generosity of our alumni, friends and partners through our Roll of Honours. Those donors who have made an exceptional commitment, shown outstanding generosity or pledged a gift in their Will, are also celebrated through our recognition circles."
