            "p": "Todayâ€™s graduate job market is challenging. Students are facing greater competition than ever before and graduate jobs are receiving a vastly disproportionate ratio of applications to job positions. Globalisation means that students need to be prepared for virtual teaching, learning, working and managing. Graduate employers are also pointing to the need for greater commercial awareness and rigorous research into company and job requirements. All this has prompted the Careers Advisory Service to develop the eMentoring scheme as a means to draw on our links with experienced and successful industry expert/ alumni whose advice is invaluable. This eMentoring scheme runs for a six-month period between the autumn and spring terms and will give you the opportunity to apply for your chosen mentor based on either your degree and/ or career aspirations. The aim of the project is for you to build on the experience and knowledge of your mentor as well as getting hints and tips on how to plan your career path. You will be communicating with your mentor by email or Skype as agreed by both you and your mentor. The Careers Advisory Service will provide support and training on being a mentee and work with you to ensure that your eMentoring relationship is successful. To apply for this module, you are required to join the briefing on 4 October 2017, Wednesday from 17:00 at F1A15. By registering to accredit this module you are agreeing to the Terms and Conditions. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8001"
