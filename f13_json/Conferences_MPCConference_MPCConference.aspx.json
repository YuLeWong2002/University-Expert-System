            "p": "Thank you to all who helped to make the Malaysian Psychology Conference 2011 a great success! We had over 500 delegates from across Malaysia and beyond, who presented more than 50 talks and more than 40 posters. The high quality of presentations reflected the high quality of research going on in psychology departments across Malaysia. The theme of the conference was \"Bringing Psychology Together\", and we welcomed delegates from all branches of psychology, at all career levels: students, researchers, teachers and practitioners of psychology Photographs of the day are now available. Thanks Yvonne Teoh for being our photographer! The programme is now available to download.
