            "p": "How has foreign occupation shaped culture? What has been the lasting cultural legacy of foreign occupation in those societies where it represented a common state of affairs for much of the modern era? These are key questions which, in light of ongoing cases of occupation around the world, remain crucial in the 21st century. Cultures of Occupation in Twentieth Century Asia (COTCA) will address these questions by analysing how occupation - be it under colonial, wartime or Cold War powers â€“ gave rise to unique visual, auditory and spatial regimes in East and Southeast Asia. The core objective of this project is to produce a paradigm shift in the study of occupation, and to challenge the 'collaboration'/'resistance' dichotomy which has defined the field thus far. It will adopt a transnational, intertextual and comparative approach to the study of cultural expression produced under occupation. The COTCA Project will be run along three interconnected streams: These streams shall start in year one, two and three of the project respectively. The major objectives of Stream 1 (Representations of Occupation) are to: The major objectives of Stream 2 (Sounds of Occupation) are to: The major objectives of Stream 3 (Spaces of Occupation) are to: Facebook Twitter COTCA was funded by a European Research Council Consolidator Grant to the value of over 1.8 million euros.
