            "p": "The University of Nottingham recognise the importance of our students’ mental health and wellbeing. We have a dedicated team of approximately 70 staff who are part of our Wellbeing Team working across all Schools to help you and your fellow students, with any issues or problems you might experience. If you are having difficulties at, or outside of University, please initially arrange to speak to one of Support & Wellbeing Officers. You can do this by clicking on the button below ‘I need some support’. This will take you straight through to the booking system where you can choose an appointment day and time. We provide pro-active information about how you can take care of your mental health and information about specialist services you can access if you feel you are struggling.
