            "p": "This module is available to all registered students as part of the Nottingham Advantage Award scheme. The module aims to build a positive online presence for the purpose of effective job search. Professional online network sites such as LinkedIn are a powerful platform for job search, and offer an opportunity for talented students to be noticed early and to develop crucial contacts while they are still studying. Students are already using online media/social media extensively, but it is important to ensure that they have the skills to employ these in a professional manner, since companies are increasingly using social media to make decisions for hiring and firing employees. The workshops run as part of this module aim to support students in developing an appreciation of the value of having a positive online presence and the importance of continually improving their profile throughout their careers. 2.
