            "p": "This Data Protection and Confidentiality statement relates to all applications for support funds, bursaries and scholarships administered by the Funding and Financial Support team. Your application and some related information, including the outcome of the application, will be held and maintained in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The data will not be passed to any third party without your consent, except when the University is required to do so by law including reporting individual awards to the Higher Education Statistical Agency (HESA), the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) or, from April 2018, the Office for Students (OfS). Applications are generally seen only by Funding and Financial Support staff. In the case of some scholarships other University staff may see your application where this is necessary for the purpose of assessment. In some instances we may need to contact appropriate University colleagues in relation to your application (e.g. Student Services colleagues in relation to support provision) or to discuss certain aspects of your application, for example in cases where an award is co-administered with an academic school or department. For further information about how the University of Nottingham processes your personal data please see our privacy pages. Any enquiries concerning the use of data noted here should be addressed to the Funding and Financial Support team (see contact details below).
