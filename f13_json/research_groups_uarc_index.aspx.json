The centre is focused on developing innovative techniques in the survey of underwater cultural heritage sites. The Underwater Archaeology Research Centre (UARC) was established at University of Nottingham in 2004. The Centre has a particular expertise in rapid underwater survey, using cutting-edge optical and acoustic techniques, to create accurate 3D visualisations of submerged sites. The research team have experience of producing large scale photo realistic 3D models of maritime sites covering up to eight hectares in size, having worked on the Pavlopetri Project in Greece, surveying the oldest submerged town in the world. Current work includes mapping the sunken 17th-century town of Port Royal in Jamaica. Academic research is focused on the study of submerged settlements including sunken cities and lake dwellings. UARC is currently involved in a range of projects, both freshwater and maritime.
