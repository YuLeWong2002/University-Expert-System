            "p": "Because stereotypical ideas about women and men are so deeply ingrained in our understanding of ourselves and the world around us, social transformation takes time. Also, because we see women in positions of power, in workplaces, and in universities, many believe that gender equality has already been achieved and that those of us who are pushing for change are overly sensitive, have a ‘victim mentality’, or want ‘special privileges’. Thus, it is an ongoing challenge to persuade others that inequalities still run deep and that we need to rethink what are often accepted as ‘normal’ and ‘common sense’ as these can sustain gender disparities. To transform how we think about gender roles, we need to change how gender relations and cultural ideals of masculinity and femininity are represented through language and discourse. But we cannot fix the problems that we cannot see. My research exposes how language can subtly reinforce and obscure gender issues for employed women, from low-paid migrant workers to white-collar women to political leaders. I closely examine the language of institutions and organisations that can play important roles as catalysts for change, such as the media and state agencies. The outcomes of my research can facilitate policy-makers, media practitioners and companies to critically reflect on and improve their language practices.
