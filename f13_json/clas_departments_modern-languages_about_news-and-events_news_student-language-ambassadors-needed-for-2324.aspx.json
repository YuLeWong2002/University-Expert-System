            "p": "We're looking for Student Language Ambassadors (SLAs) for the upcoming academic year 23/24! The School of Cultures, Languages and Area Studies has a strong tradition of outreach with schools and college, sharing our love of languages with local school pupils and supporting teachers to encourage the continued study of languages at GCSE and A level. ⁠ What do we need? We need reliable, committed and enthusiastic SLAs from years 2 and 4 studying in the department of Modern Languages and Cultures. ⁠ What will you do? As an SLA you will have the opportunity to work at on-campus events, online and in schools (the choice, and amount of work you do, is yours). You will work with other students to motivate pupils in schools to engage with their language learning and act as a role model to those pupils with whom you interact. ⁠ What do you get? You will be paid an hourly rate of £10.42 via Unitemps and receive the appropriate in-house training and support. You also get the opportunity to apply your language skills to a real-world context and inspire the next generation of linguists. ⁠ How to apply? Complete this form and we will be in touch in early September. Our first event will be on Friday 22nd September! ⁠ Have any burning questions? Please contact Tara Webster-Deakin."
