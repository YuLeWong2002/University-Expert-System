He holds a BSocSc (Hons) degree from Universiti Sains Malaysia and a MSc from the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, UK. His research interests are democracy and democratisation, especially in divided societies, identity politics and the public sphere. In light of the current development in Malaysia's public sphere, Tan is trying to understand whether the country's fragmented civil societies can bridge the gap in terms of ethnicity and religion to emerge as an effective force for democratisation. He will also explore the meaning of democracy for ordinary Malaysians. Prior to this, he taught at a local private university on full-time basis and wrote for several newspapers.

He holds an M.A. in politics from University College Dublin and an M.A. in Social and Applied Philosophy from Marquette University.

He holds a BA (Hons) International Communications Studies from The University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus. As a disciplinary nomad, Tan works across different fields.
