            "p": "Assistant Professor, Radu joined UNM's School of Computer Science in October 2019. Previously he was a post-doctoral researcher in Software Engineering at Technical University Darmstadt, Germany. Radu obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2013 in the DistriNet Research Group at KU Leuven, Belgium. His PhD research focused on novel modelling language features for supporting software variability, software product lines, feature models and dynamic software updating. Radu obtained his M.Sc. in Computer Science from Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand in 2009 and his B.Sc. from Hochschule MÃ¼nchen, Germany in 2006. He has worked as a software engineer in industry for several years. My core research interest is in designing language concepts for programming, specification and modelling that aim at making the software developing process more efficient and the resulting software safe and trustworthy. Applications of my research include development of advanced software engineering tools such as compilers and program analysers. These are used as part of the software development life cycle, but also in other engineering disciplines where simulation and analysis of complex behaviour is of paramount importance, such as railway operations and synthetic biology. I am further invested in building international cooperation in higher education, e.g. through research and teaching exchanges and the development of joint degree programs. In the current academic year (2023-2024) I am teaching: In previous academic years I have also taught: telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8018"
