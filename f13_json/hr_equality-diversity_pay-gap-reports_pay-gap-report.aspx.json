            "p": "The University of Nottingham publishes its gender and ethnicity pay gaps annually, illustrating the difference in average pay between groups of staff regardless of grade or level they work at. This year, the university also began reporting on its disability pay gap which is calculated in the same way as the ethnicity and gender pay gap. Ethnicity and disability pay gap data is not required by legislation, however, we use the same calculations as required by the gender pay gap legislation. A pay gap is different to the concept of equal pay. Equal pay is based on the pay differences between two groups of people who carry out the same jobs, similar jobs or work of equal value. For the university, equal value is defined and measured by each of our current staff levels (1-7). It is unlawful to pay people unequally because of their gender. Gender pay legislation requires employers with 250 or more employees to publish annual data clearly demonstrating how large the pay gap is between their male and female employees. The University of Nottingham is covered by, and fully complies with, public sector regulations. The legislation is based on a snapshot of pay at the census date of 31 March for the relevant reporting year. These calculations make use of two types of averages: It takes all salaries in the sample, lines them up in order from lowest to highest, and picks the middle salary. This measure is not affected by outliers at the top or bottom of the range."
