            "p": "University Park Campus, Nottingham, UK Study two languages. Studying languages is both fascinating and challenging. They break down barriers, allowing us to connect globally and share experiences. In an ever more complex world, language skills are more relevant than ever. During this degree, you will have the opportunity to hone these skills by spending a year abroad immersing yourself into both your chosen languages and cultures. Many of our students say the year abroad is their course highlight and find that they return more independent and confident with experiences and skills which make them stand out to future employers. You may choose two languages from: Mandarin Chinese, French, German, Russian, Spanish (all post-A Level or from beginners' level); and Serbian/Croatian and Portuguese (from beginners' level only). If you would like to study three languages, please see our Modern Language Studies BA. Optional Year 1 French 1: Beginners French 1 France: History and Identity Contemporary France Introduction to French and Francophone Studies Introduction to French Literature: Landmarks in Narrative Introduction to French Literature: Representations of Paris German 1: Beginners German 1 Introduction to German Studies The above is a sample of the typical modules we offer, but is not intended to be construed or relied on as a definitive list of what might be available in any given year. This content was last updated on Tuesday 8 October 2024. Due to timetabling availability, there may be restrictions on some module combinations.

As a guide 20 credits (a typical module) is approximately 200 hours of work (combined teaching and self-study). An average week will have between 12-15 hours of classes.

The University of Nottingham is consistently named as one of the most targeted universities by Britain’s leading graduate employers (Ranked in the top ten in The Graduate Market in 2013-2020, High Fliers Research). University Park Campus covers 300 acres, with green spaces, wildlife, period buildings and modern facilities. It is one of the UK's most beautiful and sustainable campuses, winning a national Green Flag award every year since 2003. Studying more than one language is challenging, but it’s definitely rewarding. The workload is quite heavy, but manageable, and I have plenty of time for extracurriculars. I would say that beginners’ languages require a lot of work, but the pace at which you learn means that you are always engaged and kept interested. I really enjoy splitting my time between the two – I never get bored and there’s always variety in what I’m studying.
