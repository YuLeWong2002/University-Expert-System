            "p": "Unlock your potential at a world-leading university with a truly international student community. Applicants from Austria are normally not required to complete a foundation course. We offer foundation courses for international students who are not qualified for direct entry to our undergraduate degree courses. These courses are available at the University of Nottingham International College, just next to University Park Campus, in partnership with Kaplan International Colleges. Find out more about the courses, entry requirements and progression options on Kaplan's website: Applications and enquiries for these courses are handled by Kaplan and the college. International foundation courses Full-time courses across our five faculties typically last for three to four years, although some degrees such as medicine and architecture have a longer duration. Students should hold the Reifeprüfungzeugnis or Matura/Maturazeugnis with an overall average mark ranging between 1.3 for the most competitive courses and 2.5 for the least competitive courses. You may also be asked to achieve a certain score (e.g. 2) in specific subjects. A typical Reifeprüfungzeugnis or Matura requirement for a course with a BBB A level entry requirement is an overall average grade of 2. Our Undergraduate Prospectus lists entry requirements for A levels and International Baccalaureate students for each course. Students taking APs or SATs should refer to our entry requirements for the USA. We offer a wide range of postgraduate masters degree programmes across our five faculties. Full-time masters courses typically last for one year. Applicants should hold a bachelors degree or Fachhochschuldiplom / Diplom (from a Fachhochschule) or Diplomstudium / Magister. Check course details in our Postgraduate Prospectus to see whether your chosen course requires the equivalent of an Upper Second Class (2:1) or Lower Second Class (2:2) degree. Our entry requirements for degrees from Austrian universities vary depending on the university where you have studied and the course you are applying for at Nottingham. The summary below is provided as guidance but requirements may vary for individual courses. Grading System Upper Second Class (2:1) Lower Second Class (2:2) Broadly same as UK Our PhD courses, available across a wide range of subject areas, typically include three years of full time research followed by an optional writing-up period of one year to complete your thesis. A masters (Diplomstudium/Magister) and bachelors from a recognised university are usually required for PhD entry. Exceptional students may be considered for PhD entry without a masters qualification. See the masters section for guidance on the grades we typically require from Austrian universities. These will vary depending on the university where you have studied and the course you are applying for at Nottingham. You should identify possible supervisors at Nottingham before applying and prepare a research proposal to submit with your application.
