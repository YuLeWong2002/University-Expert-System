            "p": "The sick pay scheme is applicable to staff in the following job families (effective from 1 October 2008): The University of Nottingham Sick Pay Scheme (referred to as the “University Sick Pay Scheme”) is designed to support employees who are absent from work due to certified sickness. During such absence, employees shall receive, by way of allowances provided by the University Sick Pay Scheme (as defined below), not more than their normal monthly salary. Any entitlement to pay under the University Sick Pay Scheme will be detailed in Contracts of Employment or any subsequent letter/amendment detailing an employee’s terms and conditions of employment. Employees who are not eligible to an allowance under the University Sick Pay Scheme are entitled to receive such statutory benefits or payments as are prescribed by law. For more information regarding payment of benefits e.g. Statutory Sick Pay please contact the Payroll Office, tel: 0115 95 15648 or visit the Department of Work and Pensions web site. Seconded staff (with substantive Nottingham posts), working at international campuses, e.g. China and Malaysia, are paid for sickness absence in accordance with their University of Nottingham contractual entitlement and the conditions of the University Sick Pay Scheme."
