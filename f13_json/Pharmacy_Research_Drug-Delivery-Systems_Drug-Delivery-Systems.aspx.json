            "p": "We work on the application of nanotechnology in design of drug delivery system to enhance the bioavailability of drugs. The design of drug formulation is also based on Quality by Design (QbD) concept. The enhancement of bioavailability and solubility is also done using solid dispersion and complexation techniques. Efforts are made to reduce the toxicity of polymers either by increasing the efficiency of polymers or by the use of biodegradable and bio-compatible polymers. Another research area of interest is on rectal drug delivery, particularly the formulation and characterization of bioadhesive suppository systems, which aims to localize suppositories to the lower vault of the rectum.
