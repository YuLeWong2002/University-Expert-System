By working with industrial partners we can ensure that our research has a lasting impact in the real world and contributes to building healthy and dynamic economies. With industrial partners such as GlaxoSmithKline and Rolls-Royce and ties to our spin-out companies based at BioCity Nottingham and elsewhere, we know we’re making the most of the incredible talent in the private sector. You can find out more about our industrial collaborations, and how to become one of our partners, by getting in touch with our Services for Business unit. Academic collaboration is a vital part of modern research, and as Britain’s global university we particularly prize our international collaborations. We’re proud of the many projects we’ve worked on with universities and other partners around the world. Some of our most notable collaborations across national borders have lead to research which is changing the way in which we think about the world, and how we live our lives.
