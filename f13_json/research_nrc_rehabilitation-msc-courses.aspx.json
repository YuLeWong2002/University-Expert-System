            "p": "The University of Nottingham, working collaboratively with the National Rehabilitation Centre (NRC), has developed four unique, innovative and interprofessional postgraduate programmes in rehabilitation: These programmes aim to give students an academic, clinical and holistic view of rehabilitation, through access to patients and clinicians within the NRC. Students will be taught in both the NRC, an innovative multi-disciplinary rehabilitation facility near Loughborough, and the Medical School Building at the University of Nottingham, which has close links with Queen's Medical Centre. Their studies will be complemented by exposure to the innovative rehabilitation services at the NRC, exchanging ideas and experiences within and between disciplines, making positive professional connections and productive networks. Students will benefit from the diverse network within the NRC, as well as research-informed teaching from a university with an international reputation for research in the medical field (REF2021). The course start date is conditional on the completion of the building of the National Rehabilitation Centre, which is scheduled for the end of 2024.
