I have enjoyed being able to use the Super Lab to look at pathogens on plants over several weeks, using specialist equipment and techniques. Another popular year two module I enjoyed was Enterprise Management Challenge. This module puts us in charge of the farm. It has included helpful advice from agronomists, lecturers and our peers to help us decide what to apply to the crops. \" Rachel Banks BSc Agriculture 56% say staff value students views and opinions about the course Data for courses in Agriculture at University of Nottingham, the For more official course information visit Discover Uni See course data Faculty of Science Entry requirements BBB UCAS code D40A Duration 3 years full-time Start date Sep 2025 UCAS code D400 Duration 3 Years full-time UCAS code D320 If you’re looking for more information, please head to our help and support hub, where you can find frequently asked questions or details of how to make an enquiry."
