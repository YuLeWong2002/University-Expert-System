            "p": "Your Support Plan may include the ability to request coursework deadline extensions and alternative exam arrangements, such as exams in smaller venues, rest breaks or extra time. Learning to manage your wellbeing and your lifestyle can be challenging, but Disability Support is here to help. Some things that we can support you with include: We can also let you know about available support across the university, such as the Sports Centre, Students' Union, the Disability Liaison Officer Network and the Student Support and Wellbeing teams in each academic department. You can contact us by emailing Disability Support Services where you will be allocated a Disability Adviser to discuss your support with you."
