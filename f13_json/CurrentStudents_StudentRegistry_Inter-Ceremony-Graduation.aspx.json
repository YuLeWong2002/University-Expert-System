            "p": "The University is aware that for some students it is particularly important that they receive their award certificate as soon as possible after they have successfully completed their course. The usual graduation arrangements may mean that a student has to wait for several months until they can receive their certificate at the graduation ceremony. An inter-ceremony graduation procedure has therefore been set up for students who must have their award certificate more quickly. Students who wish to follow the inter-ceremony procedure may apply to have their awards conferred in absentia by the University in March or October. If you choose to follow the inter-ceremony route and to have your award certificate early, this does mean that you will not be able to attend a ceremony in person. If you wish to be present at a ceremony you will have to graduate in the usual way and wait to receive your certificate at the ceremony. If you need to receive your certificate early and wish to apply for the inter-ceremony graduation, please contact the Student Registry latest by 13 February for the inter-ceremony in March and 13 September for the inter-ceremony in October. For any queries about the inter-ceremony please contact Graduation@nottingham.edu.my. The University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus Jalan Broga, 43500 Semenyih Selangor Darul Ehsan Malaysia telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8663 email: student_registry@nottingham.edu.my"
