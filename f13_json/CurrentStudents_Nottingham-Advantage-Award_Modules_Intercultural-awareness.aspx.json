            "p": "Module convenor: Ms Nabila Shariff Department: CELFE When you start getting to know people of different cultures and backgrounds, it can be an exhilarating and enormously gratifying experience. However, it could also present pitfalls and create opportunities of misunderstanding. What better way to enjoy and feel this experience without the anxiety that comes from not wanting to make assumptions than to actually learn about the concepts underlying these cultural behaviours? That is precisely what Intercultural Awareness is for. It will involve examining the unspoken aspects of culture as well as the dichotomies that are found inside of this. The module aims to educate and enlighten those who are interested in becoming more of a part of cultural awareness that exceeds superficial levels. All sessions are from 18:00 to 20:00. Venue of each session will be informed separately.
