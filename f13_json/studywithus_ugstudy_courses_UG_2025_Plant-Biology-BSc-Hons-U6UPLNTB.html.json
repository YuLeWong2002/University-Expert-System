Plant and crop scientists have a vital role in the future of food. Our plant biology degree teaches you how to experiment with and investigate plant growth. You'll understand how plants develop, reproduce and how they evolve to respond to their environment. Mandatory Year 1 Academic Skills Environmental Science and Society Genes, Molecules and Cells Introduction to Plant Science Plant Science Research Tutorials Principles of Ecology The above is a sample of the typical modules we offer, but is not intended to be construed or relied on as a definitive list of what might be available in any given year. This content was last updated on Thursday 13 June 2024. Due to timetabling availability, there may be restrictions on some module combinations. In your first year, you will take 120 credits in core modules. As a guide, one credit equals approximately 10 hours of work. You will spend around half of your time in lectures, seminars and practicals. The remaining time will be independent study. PhD students help supervise or demonstrate in some practical classes.

The University of Nottingham is consistently named as one of the most targeted universities by Britain’s leading graduate employers (Ranked in the top ten in The Graduate Market in 2013-2020, High Fliers Research). University Park Campus covers 300 acres, with green spaces, wildlife, period buildings and modern facilities. It is one of the UK's most beautiful and sustainable campuses, winning a national Green Flag award every year since 2003. I chose Nottingham as this is the largest community of plant and crop researchers in the UK with access to amazing resources such as the Hounsfield facility where the ‘hidden half’ of plants is revealed by CT-Scanners. I’ve covered everything from molecular biology and how plants sense their environment to plant pathology, all of which I’ve loved.
