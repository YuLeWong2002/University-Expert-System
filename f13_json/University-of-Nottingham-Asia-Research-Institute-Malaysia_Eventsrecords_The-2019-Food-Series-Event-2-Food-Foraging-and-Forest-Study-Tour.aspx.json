            "p": "Hosted by the Temuan community of Kampung Tohor, this study tour is limited to 25 guests who will experience the connection between the forest and food first-hand. The morning will see the local community guiding guests through their local lands on a foraging expedition. Bountiful harvests will then be prepared by the community and guests and served for lunch, following traditional Temuan recipes. Continuing from the themes discussed at the panel session the day before, this study tour will allow guests to explore the impact of environmental and developmental changes on food gathering and connections with the forest. Guests can also explore other connections beyond food, such as local crafts and water systems.
