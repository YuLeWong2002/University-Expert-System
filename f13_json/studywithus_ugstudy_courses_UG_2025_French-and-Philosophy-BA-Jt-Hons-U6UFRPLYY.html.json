            "p": "University Park Campus, Nottingham, UK Do you dream of learning French, spending time in the Francophone world and getting to grips with the diverse cultures of various French-speaking countries? Yet, are you also driven by a curiosity to better understand society and make sense of your place in the world? If your answer to these two questions is yes, then this is the degree for you. The departments of French and Philosophy allow you to develop understanding and skills in these two highly complementary subjects. With Philosophy modules ranging from ‘Gender, Justice and Society’ to ‘Mind and Consciousness’ and French modules taking you from ‘Enlightenment Literature’ to ‘Sociolinguistics’ – you’re able to truly personalise this degree around your personal interests or career aspirations.
