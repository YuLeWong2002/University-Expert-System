            "p": "This course is a design-based masters degree that provides advanced training in integrated environmental design and sustainability in the built environment. The course will equip you with the necessary skills to integrate environmental and sustainable design principles from an early stage in the design process, enabling you to deliver truly sustainable buildings. The course builds on a unique project-based approach, with emphasis on the integration of technical and theoretical knowledge and skills in building design studio. This course is suitable for those with training in architecture and other building design subjects, with a deep sense of responsibility toward creating a more habitable planet for current and future generations. and 5th in the UK for Architecture QS World University Rankings by Subject 2023 in the Russell Group universities for ‘overall satisfaction’ in Architecture The National Student Survey 2022 architecture school in the country Architects Journal (2020) In the autumn and spring semesters, you will complete 120 credits worth of modules including two design modules. These are studio-based exercises where practical skills and creativity are challenged and examined through an architectural project. Additional lectures and seminar modules provide a parallel knowledge base and intellectual support for the design project and for the final dissertation. You will spend the summer semester producing a 60-credit supervised dissertation or design thesis. This will be an in-depth study of an individually determined topic and is an opportunity to conduct a major piece of independent research that reflects individual interests and aspirations. This module introduces basic sustainable and environmental design principles and predictive methods for exploring the environmental performance of buildings. Emphasis is placed on selective use of performance prediction tools (i.e. computer simulation and physical model testing) to enhance the design decision-making process. These tools are used to study the daylighting, thermal and ventilation aspects of architectural design, which form the basis for the integration of energy efficiency and sustainability in building design. The purpose of this module is to develop architectural, urban design skills and awareness through the design of architectural and urban interventions at an appropriate scale and resolution, in response to a brief. Students are encouraged to engage with a specific design specialism, to adopt novel approaches to the generation of design concepts, and to develop these in detail in response to the circumstances of both the physical, cultural and intellectual context of the project. This is a studio-based design module within a specialist design units (for example: architecture design, museum design, tall buildings, sustainable architecture design, architectural tectonics, sustainable urban design). The projects will involve the design of an architectural or urban intervention at an appropriate scale and resolution in response to an advanced design brief. The module provides higher-level skills and understanding necessary for postgraduate study within specialist streams and explores the integration and development of advanced specialist concepts, ideas, technologies and thinking within the architectural and urban design environment. Throughout the semester, students are expected to undertake in-depth conceptual development, design research, design testing and evaluation, and final presentation.

Throughout the semester, students are expected to undertake in-depth conceptual development, design research, design testing and evaluation, presentation and communication. This module enables students to acquire the core skills used in research and practice these through an exploration of a specialist subject relevant to architecture and the built environment. This module covers the skills and resources needed to conduct independent academic research, including how to present findings effectively. It will cover choosing a research topic, how to shape research literature search techniques, including the use of the web. As a result, students will be able to conduct their own primary research, including quantitative and qualitative methodologies; data collection and simple statistical analysis. Opportunities to practice these skills will be presented through participation in a mixture of lectures, seminars and workshops designed to introduce specialist subject areas relevant to the field of architecture and related disciplines. The Case Study Project is a module focused on learning from existing buildings and/or urban spaces through post-occupancy and performance monitoring and evaluation. The module offers opportunities for students to explore environmental design issues in depth, to further develop their preferred speciality and to develop academic writing skills. Much of the work produced in this module has been published in international conferences or journals. This module aims to enable students to plan, implement and write up a substantial piece of original research that will make a contribution to the intellectual life of the discipline. Students can choose between a research dissertation or a design thesis project in the Summer term. The dissertation module aims to enable students to plan, implement, and write up a substantial piece of original research that will make a contribution to the intellectual life of the discipline of urban design. The dissertation seeks to enable students to: The design thesis project module is a research and studio-based module that aims to further develop advanced level design skills and knowledge. The structured project within the module builds upon the design, practical, and theoretical modules in the Autumn and Spring semesters and involves the completion of a detailed thesis design solution that should reflect the investigative research that is conducted through a written design research report. The design thesis project will enable students to: Our MArch Architecture and Sustainable Design programme deals with the application of the theoretical and technological aspects of environmental design and sustainable architecture in equal measures in creative studio design projects. This course emphasises problem solving, where technical and theoretical knowledge are integrated into design projects, and a unique learning method in environmental design education, where you learn the theory alongside applying it in practice. You will learn principles of sustainable design and tools to develop and assess sustainability and carbon management through lectures, seminars and workshops. These principles and tools will then be used to inform studio design projects supported by tutorials. Studio project briefs are based as much as possible on real-life projects, and participation in national or international competitions will be supported. Students will also be encouraged to present their work in national or international conferences and events. Expert staff will offer dissertation topic choices, but you are also able to choose a topic of your interest in the context that is most relevant to you, to develop your knowledge in integrated environmental design and sustainable architecture. We will use the best of digital technologies to support both your in-person and online teaching. Our teaching is delivered through live, interactive in person sessions, alongside digital and pre-recorded teaching materials that you can revisit at your own pace. Each module has a set of marking criteria aligned with its learning outcomes. This is used to assess your work via studio reviews, portfolio submissions, essays and research papers. The same goes for the dissertation, which is marked by at least two staff who are experts in the chosen subject. None of the core modules require you to seat an exam. You must pass each module with at least 50% to progress. Your final degree classification will be calculated based on the weighting of each module, which reflects their credits. Teaching for this course comprises of circa 6 contact hours per week for the lecture-based modules and circa 6 contact hours per week for the studio-based modules during term-time. This is subject to timetabling and depends on which optional modules you choose. As a guide, one credit is equal to approximately 10 hours of work, and therefore you will be expected to do a significant amount of self-study time. For your dissertation, you will receive a minimum of 30 hours of support between meetings and feedback on your progress. Class sizes vary with the modules. Studios are generally undertaken in small groups, usually between 15 to 25. Other core modules such as Advanced Sustainable Design and Case Study Project have medium size classes (usually 25-35 students), which allow us to run workshops effectively. In Architecture and Urbanism Research you will join the whole masters cohort in a large group, which will allow you to meet others outside your course.
