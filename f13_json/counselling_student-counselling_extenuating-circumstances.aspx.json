            "p": "The University's extenuating circumstances procedure The University Counselling Service is unlikely to provide evidence if you have had no prior engagement with the service. The evidence we will provide is a letter confirming the dates of the sessions you have attended. If further information is needed, this will need to be requested by your School and it will be at your Counsellorâ€™s discretion if it will be provided. As a rule if only one appointment has been attended, we will only provide you with a letter confirming attendance as evidence in all cases.
