The service was delivered into production from the initial concept in approximately four weeks with Information Services supporting the pilot Testing Service throughout; including process mapping, requirements analysis, developing a sample registration system with integrated barcode reader and providing management information Paul Couchman, Director of Technology, was part of the Information Services team heavily involved with the project, who commented: \"I think we can truly be proud of how our team have supported this initiative since its inception last year. As well as the system implications, it’s been a complex challenge of communications and logistics and many of our team have gone well beyond their remit to make it happen” By December 2020, the service had conducted over 10,000 tests and the entire cross-University project team were nominated for an award from the Institute for Public and Policy Engagement: Special Award for Pandemic Response, nominated by Professor Chris Denning: \"I wanted to say a heartfelt thank you for your enormous efforts and dedication in making all aspects of the UoN Covid-19 Testing Service operational, each of you has shown tremendous fortitude, collegiality and dedication” Andy Long, Deputy Vice-Chancellor also added his thanks to the University-wide team: \"I’d just like to add my congratulations - thoroughly deserved for all of your hard work and dedication in establishing and running the service. Thanks so much to all of you for everything you have done to keep our University community safe, Andy.\""
