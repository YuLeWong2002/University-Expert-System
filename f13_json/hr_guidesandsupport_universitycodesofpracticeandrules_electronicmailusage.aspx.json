            "p": "This policy has been developed to highlight to staff good practice which should be adopted when using the University email system for whatever purpose. It is also to be noted that the misuse or excessive use or abuse of the email system will be dealt with in accordance with the relevant disciplinary procedures. To be permitted to use any of the University computing facilities, users are deemed to have read and be bound by this policy and the following policies. The University email account is provided for the use of staff in connection with the performance of their contractual duties. However, it does permit the incidental use of the email system for personal use. Personal use is a privilege and not a right and is dependent upon not being abused or overused. The University reserves the right to withdraw permission for personal use or amend the scope of personal use at any time. If you work part-time: Human Resources Department July 2010"
