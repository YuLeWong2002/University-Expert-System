You can also follow us on Twitter This year our Hugh Stewart Hall of Residence is closed to students as it prepares for a face lift that will see the bedrooms and facilities transformed into a vibrant, accessible place that caters for our students needs now and into the future. A heritage listed building, Hugh Stewart Hall is one of our larger halls of residence on the northern end of our University Park campus. The refurbishment work will update and invigorate the residence and focus on enhancing the student experience on campus. Building on research and student feedback it will create fully accessible spaces, with communal living areas. The work will allow us to significantly improve the sustainability of the older buildings whilst retaining their heritage. The new amenity block will allow residents and visitors to take in the stunning views across the Downs and provide a vibrant social space with an ability to flex to a variety of uses. The refurbished Hall we reopen in September 2024. For further information about the work at Hugh Stewart Hall please contact Stavros Pourikas in the Development Team. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ The building will house a variety of different research groups and includes different levels of laboratories.
