IDEAS is Malaysiaâ€™s first think-tank dedicated to promoting market-based solutions to public policy challenges. We are an independent not-for-profit organisation. As a cross-partisan think tank, we work across the political spectrum. Our purpose is to advance market-based principles, and we are not bound by party politics, race or religion. Our mission is to improve the level of understanding and acceptance of public policies based on the principles of rule of law, limited government, free markets and free individuals. IDEAS offers internship opportunities for those who would like to work in a think tank environment. Interns will be given specific tasks, which usually includes owning a project.
