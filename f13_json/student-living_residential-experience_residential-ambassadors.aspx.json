They not only complement students' academic studies but also provide them with the opportunity to connect, grow as individuals, and truly thrive in their student experience.

As an RA you will be responsible for engaging with the students in halls, fostering a sense of belongingand community, through delivering and hosting a range of events and activities as part of the ResX events and activities programme. Further responsibilities include assisting with the logistics related to ResX eventsand activities resources, setting up and clearing down events and activities, proactively approaching and engaging with students, answering student queries, signposting / escalating issues and incidents as appropriate. Being an RA is an amazing opportunity, not only to help our communities in halls, but to have a lot of fun whilst doing it. You can find our RAS in every hall from 6pm-10pm Monday to Sunday. Or you can find them living it up on our socials. Check out some of our greatetst hits of the last term below. Our RA's get amazing feedback from students every day.
