            "p": "Professor, I fell in love with computers from the first time when I received my Sinclair ZX Spectrum and programmed it using BASIC in the 80s! I went to college to graduate as an electronics engineer in 1994 and worked as a computer engineer for 2 years before going to Malaysia for post-graduate studies. Both my MSc and PhD were on nonlinear and intelligent system identification and control of electrical machines, the subjects that I mainly teach, besides aerial robotics. Currently, most of my projects and supervision are mainly on robotics, especially drones. Fellow HAE Senior member of the IEEE Member of the IET CEng Served as an associate editor for IET Power Electronics. Electrical machines. Advanced AC drives. Advanced Control systems. Robotics. My research interests include nonlinear and intelligent control, electric machines and drives, embedded systems, and fault tolerance of digital systems.
