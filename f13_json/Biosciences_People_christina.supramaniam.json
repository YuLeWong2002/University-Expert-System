            "p": "Associate Professor, Dr Christina Supramaniam obtained her PhD in Molecular Plant Pathology from the University of Nottingham. Her research focuses on the epidemiology, molecular interaction, and biological control of Ganoderma basal stem rot (BSR) disease in oil palm. Dr Christina is an Assistant Professor at the School of Biosciences, and a member of the Centre of Sustainable Palm Oil Research (CESPOR) at the University of Nottingham, Malaysia. Prior to joining the University, Dr Christina was the Head of the Research Division at an International Biotechnology company and was a principle scientist for field trials to determine the efficacy of organic waste compost to improve soil microbial populations in oil palm plantations. She has vast experience working on microbial communities in diverse oil palm fields, soil types and manuring program for the suppression of BSR. Dr Christina has published several papers and has been invited to give keynote addresses on Ganoderma disease of oil palm in both local and international conferences. She has won several awards such as the UNMC- CESPOR- Eureka Synergy Research Award in 2015. She has supervised 40 undergraduate research projects and more than 10 postgraduate students. She has also been nominated as an internal examiner for four PhD candidates. Dr Christina is a reviewer for top scientific journals such as Plant Pathology (Wiley), Fungal Biology (Elsevier) and Crop Protection (Elsevier). She is an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Agency (HEA) UK and has memberships in the International Society for Plant Pathology and British Society for Plant Pathology.
