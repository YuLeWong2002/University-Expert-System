            "p": "Role models and allies are people who recognise and visibly demonstrate that everyone has an important contribution to make. Everyone has the right to feel valued and respected, the right to feel safe and that it's ok to be you. Role models and allies make a difference in peoples' lives. They inspire and motivate by representing non-mainstream identities, showing they are part of our everyday lives. An ally is someone who stands up for equal civil rights, uniting to ensure we live in an equitable society. Anyone can be an ally and it is important to be active in your support. We represent our diverse communities â€’normalising behaviours and language, creating an inclusive environment for all. LGBT+ Network Women's* Network BME Network Disabled Students Network LGBTQ+ Network Women's Network BAME Network Disabled Staff Network Unfortunately discrimination does present itself in different forms within our society. I am not naive to think that we will be successful in eliminating that 100%, but I am hopeful that we could make strides towards equality within my life time.
