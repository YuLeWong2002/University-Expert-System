Through clinical placements, case-based and simulated practice learning our newly accredited Physiotherapy BSc enables you to master the knowledge, clinical skills and confidence to become a qualified physiotherapist. We’re leading the way in physiotherapy teaching and will ensure your skills are of the highest standard for your future career. Through real-life case studies, you’ll study each area of the body in relation to a simulated patient problem. This approach to teaching corresponds to clinical practice, meaning you’re gaining knowledge of anatomy and relevant experience of patient care. Additionally, all our modules are year-long, meaning you’ll gain a thorough understanding of each aspect of the human body. As well as practical teaching, you’ll also complete a series of diverse supervised placements. Our placements are undertaken in six blocks of five weeks, giving you extended time in each clinical setting to really deepen your learning and skill set. Areas you can work in include: cardio-respiratory, intensive-care, neurology, musculoskeletal departments, community settings, as well as leadership and research placements. These placements build your confidence and abilities so that by the time you graduate, you’re able to embark on a career as a physiotherapist. At Nottingham, you’ll gain the lasting knowledge, hands-on skills, and adaptability to navigate the future challenges of healthcare.
