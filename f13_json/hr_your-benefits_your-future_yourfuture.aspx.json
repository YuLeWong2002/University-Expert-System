As we recognise the importance of career progression, a wide range of professional courses are available, helping you to excel in your chosen career. We also offer competitive pension schemes to all employees alongside other benefits, including immediate life cover for your beneficiaries and ill health retirement benefits. The University offers various pensions schemes. The one you are eligible to join will depend on your grade and position.
