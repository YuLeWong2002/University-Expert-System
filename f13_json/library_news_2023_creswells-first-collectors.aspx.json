This exhibition, curated by Dr Angharad Jones, Curator at Creswell Crags, will highlight the importance of these species (hyaenas, birds of prey, Neanderthals and early modern humans) and the items they collected, in helping us to understand the Ice Age of Creswell Craggs. This exhibition is specially curated for the University of Nottingham Museum and includes current work and research as well as collections not usually on display at Creswell Crags. 6 January – 2 July 2023 Open Thur – Sun, 12-4pm Admission free King's Meadow Campus Lenton Lane Nottingham, NG7 2NR Please see our Help and support page for telephone and email contact points"
