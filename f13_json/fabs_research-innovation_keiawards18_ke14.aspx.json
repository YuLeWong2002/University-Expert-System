In 2015, the University’s spin-out dinner evolved to the enterprise dinner – to showcase both academic and student enterprise. This was an occasion to celebrate entrepreneurship and enterprise activities across the University. The dinner will be a regular event in the calendar, every other year, providing the opportunity to recognise those students and academics who have achieved success through their entrepreneurial and innovative activities.
