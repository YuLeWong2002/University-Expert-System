            "p": "Celebrate diversity and commonality this Interfaith Week! Inter Faith Week was started by the Inter Faith Network for the UK (IFN) in 2009. Although the IFN has now closed, we continue to celebrate Interfaith Week as a multifaith Chaplaincy at the University of Nottingham. It is an important week which draws new people into inter faith learning and cooperation and enables greater interaction between people of different backgrounds. To celebrate Interfaith Week 2024 we will be launching a new interfaith buddies scheme, The Kaleidoscope Project. We will also be hosting an interfaith panel discussion looking at Humanism within a multi faith Chaplaincy."
