            "p": "Unlock your potential at a world-leading university with a truly international student community. Students from Brunei Darussalam are normally not required to complete a foundation course as the A level is accepted for undergraduate entry. We offer foundation courses for international students who are not qualified for direct entry to our undergraduate degree courses. These courses are available at the University of Nottingham International College, just next to University Park Campus, in partnership with Kaplan International Colleges. Find out more about the courses, entry requirements and progression options on Kaplan's website: Applications and enquiries for these courses are handled by Kaplan and the college. International foundation courses Full-time courses across our five faculties typically last for three to four years, although some degrees such as medicine and architecture have a longer duration. Students taking A levels or the IB should refer to the online undergraduate prospectus for entry requirements. Students taking APs or SATIIs should refer to entry requirements for the USA. We offer a wide range of postgraduate masters degree programmes across our five faculties. Full-time masters courses typically last for one year. A bachelors degree from a recognised university will be considered for masters entry. Check course details in our Postgraduate Prospectus to see whether your chosen course requires the equivalent of an Upper Second Class (2:1) or Lower Second Class (2:2) degree. Our entry requirements for degrees from Bruneian universities vary depending on the university where you have studied and the course you are applying for at Nottingham. The summary below is provided as guidance but requirements may vary for individual courses and we do require higher grades from some universities. Entry requirement Upper Second Class (2:1) Lower Second Class (2:2) Brunei Classification 2:1 Honours classification, or CGPA 3.20 – 3.79 2.2 Honours classification, or CGPA 2.6 – 3.19 Our PhD courses, available across a wide range of subject areas, typically include three years of full time research followed by an optional writing-up period of one year to complete your thesis.
