            "p": "Our international community of staff and students are at the heart of our University. Over 150 countries are currently represented by those who study and work with us, and we aim to engender a global mindset among our staff and students. We warmly welcome those of different cultures, ethnicities and beliefs â€“ indeed this very diversity is vital to our success, it is fundamental to our values and enriches life on campus. We aim to make your transition to living and working in Nottingham as smooth as possible. Colleagues in the HR International Employment Services Team are available to support you, for example with immigration matters and related expenses. For all successful international applicants, we provide financial support for your visa and the immigration health surcharge, plus an interest-free loan to help cover the cost of immigration-related expenses for any dependants accompanying you to the UK."
