We perform laboratory assessment of materials and technologies for existing and future transport infrastructures. We develop novel computational methods to facilitate improved design of coastal infrastructure defences. We are concerned with the sustainability and resilience of transportation infrastructure, sustainability of coastal defences, the management and maintenance of the existing infrastructure asset as well as envisioning future transport systems.
