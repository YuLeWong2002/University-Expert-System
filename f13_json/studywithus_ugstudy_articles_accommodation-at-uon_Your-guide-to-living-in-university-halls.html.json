            "p": "Get familiar with your university halls - from where to collect parcels to how to do laundry Moving away from home to start the next independent chapter of your life is an incredible journey of self-discovery. You'll meet lifelong friends, have unforgettable experiences, and learn the skills and tools you need to be successful in your chosen career. This period of your life will be exciting, but it can also be a big adjustment if this is your first time living away from the comforts of home. Getting familiar with your university halls, from where to collect parcels to how to do laundry, will help make the transition a little smoother. We’ve pulled together some key information to guide you through the process. If you’re living in University-owned halls on University Park and Jubilee campus (plus Dagfa House and Varsity) then your Active Living package is included in your accommodation. It offers all the same benefits as our UoN sport and fitness membership, plus an exclusive schedule of sessions and events for you and your hall friends. You can find out more about the package here. If you are living in other accommodation, then our great value sport and fitness membership for students is a fantastic option. It covers all three of our campus locations, including access to our fitness suites, pool, climbing wall and over 150 weekly classes. You can find out more here. If you’re looking for more information, please head to our help and support hub, where you can find frequently asked questions or details of how to make an enquiry."
