            "p": "We are born to communicate. Through objects and images, sounds and words, we declare our passions, entertain each other and influence the world around us. Cultural, Media and Visual Studies examines and makes sense of all this activity. Our work spans centuries - from Renaissance paintings to posthumanism and cyberbodies. As much as the \"what\" we ask the \"why\" and the \"who\". Why do things that way? Who benefits? And who doesn't?

Explore our themes and what it's like to study and research with us. Honest opinions about studying here Research interests and contact details"
