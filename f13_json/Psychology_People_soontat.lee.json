            "p": "Assistant Professor, I graduated with a BSc (Hons) in Speech Science from the National University of Malaysia. After working for five years as a speech-language therapist in a public hospital, I pursued a PhD at the School of Psychology, University of Nottingham Malaysia. In 2024, I began my role as an Assistant Professor at the same institution. My research focuses on the intersection of speech-language therapy and psycholinguistics, particularly on enhancing bilingual language processing, testing, and learning. As a psycholinguist and speech-language therapist, I am fascinated by the cognitive and linguistic mechanisms involved in bilingual language processing, particularly how bilinguals acquire, comprehend, and produce words in the languages they speak. Additionally, I have a strong passion for language testing and test validation. Much of my current work focuses on developing language tests that assess specific language constructs in understudied language pairs such as Malay-English and Mandarin-English, and conducting language experiments using these tests to investigate the relationships between different aspects of language knowledge. The greater purpose of this work is to develop evidence-informed assessments with a practical impact for both researchers and practitioners to enhance language learning in multilingual contexts, including those with learning difficulties. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8018"
