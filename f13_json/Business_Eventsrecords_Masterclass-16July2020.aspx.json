Women in the workplace still face challenges in relation to career progression and entrepreneurship. These challenges tend to greater in ‘traditionally male’ disciplines - such as science, engineering, technology and medicine – and professions such as law and finance. Dr Lorna Treanor, from Nottingham University Business School UK, talks about her research, explaining how these challenges arise and manifest and highlighting the important role men have in ensuring equality in the modern workplace. Lorna is a Divisional Research Director at the Haydn Green Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Nottingham University Business School, UK. She is also Consulting Editor of the International Small Business Journal and a co-founder of the Gender & Enterprise Network.
