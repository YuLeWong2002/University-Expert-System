            "p": "Non-competitive, guaranteed funding for eligible students Our bursaries help University of Nottingham students fund their time at university to ease some financial pressure while they’re studying with us. Unlike a student loan, bursaries are non-repayable, and you’re free to spend it in any way you’d like to help you while you study. Bursaries are usually based on your financial situation, personal circumstances or the subject you study. The Core Bursary, Nottingham Potential Bursary and Care Experienced and Estranged Bursary have unlimited places. This means anyone who meets the criteria of these bursaries will receive the funding. But every bursary works differently, so explore the options below to find out if you are eligible, how to apply and how they will be paid once you start university. If your household income is less than £35,000 If circumstances have impacted academic potential If you have been in care or estranged For student on a range of vocational courses For care experienced and estranged students If you don’t meet the criteria for these bursaries, you may still be able to apply for a scholarship.
