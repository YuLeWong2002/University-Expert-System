            "p": "The Nottingham Confucius Institute (NCI) is proud to be one of the official HSK test centres in the UK authorised by Chinese Test International and the Center for Language Education and Cooperation (CLEC). NCI can administer written tests (HSK level 1~level 6) and oral tests (HSKK). Those who achieve high marks in HSK tests may be eligible to apply for scholarships offered by CLEC to study in China. For details on the scholarship application procedure please visit our website. HSK tests at NCI are usually held in March, May and December. Registration for each exam is required approximately one month prior to the test date. Step one - visit the University online store to pay the registration fee required by Chinese Testing International. Step two - register for the exam online. During the process, a step called “pay online” will appear: please ignore it as this is designed only for those who take exams in China. View the Registration Guidance here. Please note that you need to select \"paper-based test\" as test format and \"The University of Nottingham Confucius Institute\" as your test centre. Please also note that you are required to upload an ID photo (with white background, no hats- please refer to registration guidance for details) during this stage of the online registration. Should you experience difficulty in doing so, please email lufei.zheng@nottingham.ac.uk Step three - email the following documents to lufei.zheng@nottingham.ac.uk before the deadline with ‘HSK exam registration - your name’ in the subject line (e.g. ‘HSK exam registration - John Smith’) View our privacy notice to find out how we process your personal data. Your HSK permit will be emailed to you after your application has been processed. You will need to bring a hard copy of this permit along with personal ID (ID card, driving licence or passport) to the test centre on the day of the exam. Failure to bring either of these will prevent you being able to enter the test venue. You will only need pencils and an eraser for the test. You are not allowed to bring dictionaries or other written materials with you. You will be able to check the test results approximately one month after the test date on www.chinesetest.cn. You will be notified by email as soon as the test certificates arrive at NCI. Collection can then be arranged from the NCI Library (A23, Si Yuan Centre, Jubilee Campus). Registration deadline: 12:00 noon, 9 February 2025 We offer a number of Free Online HSK Exam Prep Courses in both Spring and Autumn terms. Register or find out more here.
