            "p": "This theme is leading research in earth and environmental systems over a range of spatial and temporal scales. We investigate patterns and processes within the biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere to make inferences about past, present and future change. We are pioneering the latest technologies for geoscience data collection, analysis and knowledge transfer. Supported by state-of-the-art laboratories and information systems, we engage in fundamental and applied research with a strong focus on resource and environmental management, biodiversity, risk mitigation and ecosystem restoration. Four sub-themes summarise our range of activities: Members of this theme are participating in the: School of Geography Sir Clive Granger Building University of Nottingham University Park Nottingham, NG7 2RD +44 (0)115 951 5559"
