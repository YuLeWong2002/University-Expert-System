            "p": "The Centre for Mathematical Medicine and Biology (CMMB) is led from within the School of Mathematical Sciences and comprises members of the University of Nottingham who use mathematical methods to provide insights into biological and biomedical phenomena. We aim to promote the application of mathematical modelling to medicine and the biomedical sciences, and to stimulate multi-disciplinary research within the University and beyond. The CMMB is an Institute Partner of the Mathematical Biosciences Institute (MBI) at Ohio State University. The CMMB is coordinating the new UK Multi-Scale Biology Network funded by BBSRC. The CMMB played host to the Annual Meeting of the Society for Mathematical Biology and European Conference for Mathematical and Theoretical Biology in Summer 2016. Further details are available on the conference website. Abstracts and photos from the conference are also available. CMMB is located in the School of Mathematical Sciences on University Park Campus.
