In years one and three you'll have optional modules to choose from. This is your chance to explore the areas of psychology that you find interesting. As we have experts across the spectrum of psychology, we are able to offer you a choice from different areas. For example, the Neuropsychology and Applied Neuroimaging module covers the effect of brain damage. You'll learn how it can impair language, memory and motor control.
