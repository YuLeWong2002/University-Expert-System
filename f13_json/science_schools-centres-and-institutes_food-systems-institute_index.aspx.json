            "p": "Sowing ideas, cultivating solutions Our mission is to ensure access to palatable, healthy and sustainable food for all, while protecting and regenerating the Earth's natural resources in the face of climate change. We bring together researchers from across disciplines and work with industry and policymakers to deliver solutions to transform the food system. We do this work through our translational centres, addressing challenges across the entire food system, from production and processing, through to transport, consumption and waste. Our approach is to bring together stakeholders and find a common goal working towards sustainable and healthy food systems at a local, national and global level. Our ambitious research endeavours to address challenges across three pillars: Making our food systems less fragile Developing more equitable and inclusive food systems for all in society Improving population dietary health for a reduced death toll We are impacting the food system through our interdisciplinary translational centres. Shaping local, national and global policy with our research Working with business to make our agricultural systems more sustainable Supporting businesses to innovate in the food and drink sector Reimagining our future protein production systems Find out what we are doing and how to get involved We connect Nottingham researchers with policymakers and industry partners. Our institute works across all five faculties at the University, exploring food system challenges from production to waste."
