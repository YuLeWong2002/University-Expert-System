            "p": "The Careers Advisory Service conducts a bi-annual Graduate Destination Survey (GDS), the official survey for destinations of all UNM graduates. Take heed that some of the career choices you are considering today may change after you graduate. Your degree discipline is only a piece of who you are and what you can offer to the employer. In fact, the degree discipline you choose does not limit you to a handful of careers. It is likely to offer you many incredible options not listed here. Exploring those options across a number of job sectors may provide you with an understanding of your own unique abilities, weaknesses and career interests. telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8001 email: enquiries@nottingham.edu.my"
