            "p": "The good health of individual staff members is a primary requirement for their effective performance at work. Psychological wellbeing is as important to an individual as good physical health. Without healthy, effective and efficient staff the University will not function effectively. We have a statutory duty of care to our staff and through a variety of published policies establish a framework of procedures that ensure a safe and healthy working environment within which staff can operate."
