            "p": "The dynamic world of biomedical sciences underpins much of modern healthcare. As illnesses and treatments become more sophisticated, so does the need for more understanding of the human body and the effects of drugs and diseases. The diversity of this subject area is reflected in the key disciplines that comprise the Division of Biomedical Sciences: anatomy, biochemistry, neuroscience, pharmacology and physiology. The division employs international scientists who are experienced in their field of expertise, providing you with scientific knowledge and practical skills. Students completing a research degree can undertake molecular or non-molecular research. Molecular research involves using cutting-edge molecular biology techniques, while non-molecular research utilises techniques. Biomedical Sciences is at the forefront of understanding and combating diseases, ensuring the well-being of populations worldwide. Here's why you should consider studying Biomedical Sciences at the University of Nottingham Malaysia: Cutting-edge research: Engage in research that addresses pressing health challenges, from tropical diseases to genetic disorders.
