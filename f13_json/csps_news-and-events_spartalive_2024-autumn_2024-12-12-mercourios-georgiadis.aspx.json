            "p": "Sparta Live! Summary of talk: The peak sanctuaries were developed on the island of Crete during the MB-LB I period (c. 2000-1500 BC). Their use spread to other islands across the Aegean, including Kythera where a unique sacred landscape was developed. In this presentation the character of the various cultic sites on Kythera will be discussed and analysed. The sites, their locations, the offerings and the form of the rituals that were taking place there will be considered on their own and in relation to all the available evidence. The peak sanctuary at Leska had been one of the newest additions in this discussion that allowed a broader analysis of cultic activities across Kythera. In this context, it will be demonstrated that Kythera developed a complex sacred landscape that included various cultic sites where different rituals and beliefs were expressed. All these elements provided a unique religious identity to this island during the MB III-LB I period, which acted as a cultural bridge between Crete and southern mainland Greece transferring new ideas and practices.
