She also completed a masters degree at the University of Nottingham, graduating in 2003. The University launched this scholarship in 2013, with Deng Yaping's support, to honour her achievements and to help Chinese athletes achieve their academic and sporting ambitions. Applications are now open. Please note there are two application deadlines, depending on the length of presessional English course you require.
