            "p": "Training helps staff and students to be competent in the University tasks they undertake. It is therefore important to ensure everyone's health and safety training needs have been identified and the training undertaken to a satisfactory standard with refreshment opportunities as appropriate. Health and safety training may be very general and applicable to all, e.g. induction, fire safety; it may be skills-based, e.g. safe use of ladders, learning how to do a risk assessment; or it can be job-specific, e.g. training in a lab procedure or use of work equipment. Some H&S training will be mandatory with a set timeframe for refresher, some will be be useful and support an individual's development. Click on the options below to learn more.
