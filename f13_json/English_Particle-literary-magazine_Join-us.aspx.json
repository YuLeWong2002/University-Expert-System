            "p": "Positions within Particle can be divided into two categories: the editorial team and the administrative team. Our editorial team usually consists of students from the School of English as experience and knowledge about the craft are vital. The departments are Poetry, Fiction, Creative Nonfiction, and Artworks & Photography. Our administrative team is open to any students as long as you have the skills. For the next academic year, we open up recruitment at the end of spring semester of the preceding year. After the forms are closed, applicants are then shortlisted for interviews. Once our candidates have been chosen, they will go through a short training period in preparation for taking up magazine operations next year. If you’re interested in applying, keep an eye out for updates on vacancies on our website or follow our social media here. If you believe you’d be a valuable asset to our team now, then reach out to us at: particlemagazineunmc@gmail.com with “INTERESTED IN JOINING” as the subject header. telephone: +603 8924 8000 fax: +603 8924 8001"
