In collaboration with CGI, the university’s external Digital Partner, we have had the CGI Cyber Escape experience on campus – an immersive, travelling Escape room! David Hill, Chief Digital Officer, has announced the re-naming and future strategic direction of the Information Services department. Over the last three years, Information Services has transitioned from being a traditional IT provider to a digital partner. The CO-CONNECT Project (Covid - Curated and Open analysis and research platform) will support access to information from 44 sources, standardising antibody data collection from across the UK and building a secure and trustworthy federated platform for researches to access. The University is committed to improving the IT systems and processes that we all work with to ensure they are simple and easy to use. The introduction of our new IT customer service platform (Ivanti Service Manager) has streamlined workflows and tasks behind the scenes to ensure support requests and incidents are directed with greater efficiency. Launched on 5 October 2020, the University of Nottingham Asymptomatic testing service was established to counter the hidden spread of Covid-19 and keep staff, students and the local community safe."
