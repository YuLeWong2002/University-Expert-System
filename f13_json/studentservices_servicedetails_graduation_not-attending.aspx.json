            "p": "What you need to do if you are unable to attend your ceremony Registration for our winter 2024 ceremonies has now closed. If you haven't registered a choice of how you would like to graduate, as long as you are eligible, you will automatically graduate in absentia and receive your certificate and transcripts through the post following our December ceremonies. Even if you can't attend your graduation ceremony, we hope you will stay connected with the university after you graduate. Want to continue your learning and get access to top tips from leaders in your sector and beyond? How about webinars to develop your professional skills, masterclasses hosted by experts in their field, seminars led by academics, and networking opportunities with your global alumni community? Simply opt-in to receive communications from your Alumni team when you complete registration to hear about these exclusive opportunities and so much more."
