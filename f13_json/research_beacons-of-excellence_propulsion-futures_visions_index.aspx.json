            "p": "To remain at the forefront of sustainable, responsible and carbon-neutral transport in the aerospace, automotive and marine sectors, we have invested £13 million in our technical capabilities, research specialists and demonstrator platforms. Discovering and exploring new, viable materials, components and technologies is at the heart of what we do. By focusing on specific research themes, our overarching aim is to develop innovative electrified propulsion systems that will form a new age of sustainable transport. See how we’re making electric transport commercially viable. We are exploring ways to generate and store energy in vehicles. How can we reduce the carbon footprint of components? Which developments have the potential to disrupt vehicle propulsion? Learn why the propulsor is critical to the development of system performance. See how we intend to showcase our research and development. How can onboard power generation drive the uptake of electric vehicles? We’re home to leading experts in propulsion."
