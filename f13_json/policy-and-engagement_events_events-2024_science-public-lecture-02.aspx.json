Event poster On a research trip to the Isaac Newton telescope, Dr Julian Onions had the chance to carry out some observations using the 2.5 m Isaac Newton telescope. Should be straightforward, right? Just point and click? Not quite! So, what does it actually take to set up and use a professional telescope? How do you plan and execute an observing run? Come along to our February public science lecture to learn the answer to all these questions and more, as Julian shares his experience of using this amazing piece of equipment!
