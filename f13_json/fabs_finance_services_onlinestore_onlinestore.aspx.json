Online Store card payment pages can cater for everything from simple payments for physical items like clothing and mugs, to document ordering, admin fees and field trips, as well as more specialised setups for conference and event bookings and short courses. Any process where departments need to take payment and/or capture booking or registration details can be setup to run automatically using this service, sending the money to a designated project code with all the information available via excel friendly online reports.
