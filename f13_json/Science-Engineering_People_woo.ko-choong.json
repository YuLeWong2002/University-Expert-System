Member of many Scientific and Technical Committees in international conferences. My research interests centre on the use of analytical methods of Nonlinear Dynamics to solve engineering problems. In particular, numerical methods to facilitate design, and the associated issues of control are main features of my work. Experimental investigations are often a key feature of my activities, and complement the theoretical analyses performed. The foci of my attention are nonlinear mechanical vibrations, vibro-impact dynamics, fracture and fatigue and condition monitoring. I collaborate actively and have been invited to be a conference speaker. Industrial collaboration is consistently being sought and consolidated, and I warmly welcome any interactions with anyone who has similar interests. Teaching interests include dynamics and analytical methods. Nonlinear dynamics; nonlinear oscillations; mechanical vibrations; approximate analytical methods; numerical techniques; experimental correlation; application to vibro-impact ma-chines;â€¦ read more telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8001"
