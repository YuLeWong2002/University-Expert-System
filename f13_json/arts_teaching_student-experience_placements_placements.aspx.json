            "p": "A placement is time spent in a workplace, doing supervised work, during your studies or shortly after graduation. You might see placements advertised as ‘internships’, ‘work experience’, or ‘volunteering’, as different organisations use different terms. What’s most important is that you choose an opportunity that interests you, and will help you develop skills future employers value. A placement will help you to: We offer a range of placement opportunities, including term-time and holiday options, paid opportunities, and placements you complete for course credit. Dedicated opportunities for students in particular schools include: School of Cultures, Languages and Area Studies School of English School of Humanities Help an academic with their research Read about Chloe's experience With our excellent reputation for producing high-quality graduates local, national and international organisations are keen to offer placements for our students. Paid opportunities to get industry experience Work as part of a team on a real client project In-depth course led by industry professionals Build vital skills, knowledge and contacts We are sometimes contacted by local businesses and organisations hoping to recruit a placement student. No opportunity is the same - what they offer, when they run and who can take part depends on the individual placement. We advertise these by email to your student account - keep an eye out for the latest opportunities! If you would like to host a placement for one of our students email Hayley Revill.
