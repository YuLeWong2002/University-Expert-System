            "p": "Building on the resources of Nottingham University Business School (NUBS) Malaysia and our cross-disciplinary culture of learning through the university's network of campuses in China and the UK, we aim to work with organisations to motivate, retain and develop their human capital in a changing economic environment. NUBS Malaysia and UN Global Compact Malaysia and Brunei (UNGCMYB) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on 6 May 2021 to promote sustainability and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in business and society, through joint activities related to reseach, executive education and training, hosting of seminars and conferences, and business leaders' sessions in various topics on sustainability. More information will be available soon on joint executive education and training activities that will be offered in collaboration with UNGCMYB. NUBS Malaysia Executive Education also curates the NUBS Malaysia Masterclass Series, which connects the university community, alumni and industry partners in engaging sessions with thought leaders on contemporary business ideas and challenges. Masterclasses are complimentary and are open to alumni and invited guests.
