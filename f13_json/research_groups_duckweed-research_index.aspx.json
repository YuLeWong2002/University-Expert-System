            "p": "We are a collection of research teams working on duckweeds. Duckweeds are the smallest and the fastest-growing flowering plants on Earth. Due to their simple body plan and ease of growth, they provide a highly tractable experimental model for asking fundamental biological questions. Their rapid growth and high protein content position duckweed as a future food and a chassis for synthetic biology. Collectively, our interests span both fundamental and applied research questions.
