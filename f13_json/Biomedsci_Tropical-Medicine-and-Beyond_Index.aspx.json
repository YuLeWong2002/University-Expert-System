            "p": "The module is designed to introduce health affiliated students to diseases and treatment commonly found in tropical regions and is of concern and focus of the WHO. It also aims at increasing awareness of alternative and complementary treatment practiced in this region. An understanding of neglected tropical diseases will take students beyond looking at disease and medicine but at factors like education which can alleviate health issues amongst underprivileged populations. The module is aligned to meet identified UN global goals for 2030; eliminate poverty, achieve good health and well-being, provide quality education and, ensure clean water and sanitation. Knowledge on these areas is to be disseminated via lectures, practical/demo, visits and hands-on workshop session. \"Unique unforgettable experience. Really interesting topics, lecture and inspiring visits\" \"It's taught me a range of diseases in the developing world; things not commonly taught in the UK. It's been great stepping outside of my comfort zone & meeting so many lovely people on the module.\" \"I found the module very interesting and there was a good breadth of information covered overall. I really enjoyed having a mixture of lectures one day and visits another day as this gave variety\" Follow our blog! Virtual tour telephone: +6 (03) 8924 8000 fax: +6 (03) 8924 8018"
