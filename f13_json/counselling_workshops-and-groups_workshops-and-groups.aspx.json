            "p": "Workshops are often one-off events (sometimes they are made up of 2 linked sessions) with a specific theme, such as perfectionism, self-esteem or anxiety. Workshop sessions will have input from the counsellor running it, as well as reflective exercises to allow discussion and sharing of experiences from students attending. They are often focussed on finding practical ways of managing specific issues. Workshops are self-referral. Groups are run as counselling in a group setting, and meet regularly (weekly or monthly). Attendees get to know other group members and can benefit from support and understanding from other participants, as well as hearing different perspectives. To enrol on a group you must have been seen for an individual counselling appointment first. You can register for an appointment here. Our 5 minute podcast covers groups and workshops and the advantages of coming to one and how they work.
