            "p": "The aim of our research group is to determine the molecular mechanisms that contribute to cellular signalling, cell damage and cell death. Our focus is clinically related toxicology, biochemistry, and physiology. Our bodies are exposed to an ever-increasing number of toxins including licit or illicit drugs, and environmental agents such as pesticides. The impact of these toxins on our health and well-being needs to be investigated and monitored. Furthermore, the development of suitable treatments able to respond to agent toxicity are required. Current research projects include: Through our research we have shown that: Our research has been published in leading peer-reviewed journals. See our individual staff profiles to find out more. We also deliver clinical toxicology teaching to the Medical Physiology and Therapeutics and Medicine BSc students.
