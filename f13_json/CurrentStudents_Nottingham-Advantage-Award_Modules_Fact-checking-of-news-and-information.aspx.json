            "p": "The module will introduce students to the importance of media literacy in this era of information overload. Students will be engaged in fact checking activities, guided by the UNM fact checking team and with the national partner, FaqCheck Lab. Students will then use the period (whether in Autumn or Spring) to do live fact checks on stories about social issues that have been predetermined. Students can choose to do image search, research or communication tasks as assigned by the module convenor as part of the fact checks. They can also choose to do interviews with experts as and when required by the editors at FaqCheck for the specific stories. Each student is expected to work on at least one fact check during their module term. At the end of the module students will prepare a 500-word reflective journal on their experiences, learning outcomes and contributions to the fact checking process.
