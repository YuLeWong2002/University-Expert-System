Our Student Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy has been co-created with staff, students, the Students' Union and other partners to ensure that support is inclusive, evidence-based and tailored for all students within our community. It is recognised that one in three students will experience poor mental health at some point during their studies. Our strategy has been put in place to inform all university activities and ensure that your mental, physical and social wellbeing is supported throughout every stage of your university journey. To be a university that empowers all students to take care of their own wellbeing and reach their full potential and create a healthy, supportive and inclusive environment that enables them to thrive both at the university and in the wider community. To help the student community by creating a positive culture where wellbeing is embedded throughout every area of student life, by having a cohesive and holistic approach and by providing timely and proactive support which is evidence-based and reflective. Student mental health and wellbeing strategy A comprehensive list of aims and objectives can be found in the Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy, the main themes of which are summarised below. We asked University of Nottingham students what wellbeing issues were important to them, and compiled relevant tips and guidance on the many aspects of university life into our Wellbeing Guide.
